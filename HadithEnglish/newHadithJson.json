He used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira \n          where he used to worship (Allah alone) continuously for many days \n          before his desire to see his family. He used to take with him the \n          journey food for the stay and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to \n          take his food like-wise again till suddenly the Truth descended upon \n          him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him and asked \n          him to read. The Prophet replied, \"I do not know how to read.\n         The Prophet added, \"The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so\n          hard that I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again \n          asked me to read and I replied, 'I do not know how to read.' Thereupon\n          he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I could not bear \n          it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read but again \n          I replied, 'I do not know how to read (or what shall I read)?' \n          Thereupon he caught me for the third time and pressed me, and then \n          released me and said, 'Read in the name of your Lord, who has created \n          (all that exists) has created man from a clot. Read! And your Lord is \n          the Most Generous.\" (96.1, 96.2, 96.3) Then Allah's Apostle returned \n          with the Inspiration and with his heart beating severely. Then he went\n          to Khadija bint Khuwailid and said, \"Cover me! Cover me!\" They covered\n          him till his fear was over and after that he told her everything that \n          had happened and said, \"I fear that something may happen to me.\" \n          Khadija replied, \"Never! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you. You \n          keep good relations with your Kith and kin, help the poor and the \n          destitute, serve your guests generously and assist the deserving \n          calamity-afflicted ones.\"\n         Khadija then accompanied him to her cousin Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad \n          bin 'Abdul 'Uzza, who, during the PreIslamic Period became a Christian\n          and used to write the writing with Hebrew letters. He would write from\n          the Gospel in Hebrew as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an \n          old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to Waraqa, \"Listen to \n          the story of your nephew, O my cousin!\" Waraqa asked, \"O my nephew! \n          What have you seen?\" Allah's Apostle described whatever he had seen. \n          Waraqa said, \"This is the same one who keeps the secrets (angel \n          Gabriel) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could \n          live up to the time when your people would turn you out.\" Allah's \n          Apostle asked, \"Will they drive me out?\" Waraqa replied in the \n          affirmative and said, \"Anyone (man) who came with something similar to\n          what you have brought was treated with hostility; and if I should \n          remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would \n          support you strongly.\" But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine\n          Inspiration was also paused for a while.\n         Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah Al-Ansari while talking about the period \n          of pause in revelation reporting the speech of the Prophet \"While I \n          was walking, all of a sudden I heard a voice from the sky. I looked up\n          and saw the same angel who had visited me at the cave of Hira' sitting\n          on a chair between the sky and the earth. I got afraid of him and came\n          back home and said, 'Wrap me (in blankets).'

Arise and warn (the \n          people against Allah's Punishment),... up to 'and desert the idols.' \n          (74.1-5) After this the revelation started coming strongly, frequently\n          and regularly.\"\n                \n      "},{"id":3,"hadith":" Narrated Said bin Jubair:\n         Ibn 'Abbas in the explanation of the Statement of Allah.

They were \n          merchants doing business in Sham (Syria, Palestine, Lebanon and \n          Jordan), at the time when Allah's Apostle had truce with Abu Sufyan \n          and Quraish infidels. So Abu Sufyan and his companions went to \n          Heraclius at Ilya (Jerusalem). Heraclius called them in the court and \n          he had all the senior Roman dignitaries around him. He called for his \n          translator who, translating Heraclius's question said to them, \"Who \n          amongst you is closely related to that man who claims to be a \n          Prophet?\" Abu Sufyan replied, \"I am the nearest relative to him \n          (amongst the group).\"\n         Heraclius said, \"Bring him (Abu Sufyan) close to me and make his \n          companions stand behind him.\" Abu Sufyan added, Heraclius told his \n          translator to tell my companions that he wanted to put some questions \n          to me regarding that man (The Prophet) and that if I told a lie they \n          (my companions) should contradict me.\" Abu Sufyan added, \"By Allah! \n          Had I not been afraid of my companions labeling me a liar, I would not\n          have spoken the truth about the Prophet. The first question he asked \n          me about him was:\n         'What is his family status amongst you?' \n         I replied, 'He belongs to a good (noble) family amongst us.' \n         Heraclius further asked, 'Has anybody amongst you ever claimed the \n          same (i.e. to be a Prophet) before him?'\n         I replied, 'No.'\n         He said, 'Was anybody amongst his ancestors a king?'\n         I replied, 'No.'\n         Heraclius asked, 'Do the nobles or the poor follow him?'\n         I replied, 'It is the poor who follow him.'\n         He said, 'Are his followers increasing decreasing (day by day)?'\n         I replied, 'They are increasing.'\n         He then asked, 'Does anybody amongst those who embrace his religion \n          become displeased and renounce the religion afterwards?'\n         I replied, 'No.'\n         Heraclius said, 'Have you ever accused him of telling lies before his \n          claim (to be a Prophet)?'\n         I replied, 'No. '\n         Heraclius said, 'Does he break his promises?'\n         I replied, 'No. We are at truce with him but we do not know what he \n          will do in it.' I could not find opportunity to say anything against \n          him except that.\n         Heraclius asked, 'Have you ever had a war with him?'\n         I replied, 'Yes.'\n         Then he said, 'What was the outcome of the battles?'\n         I replied, 'Sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.'\n         Heraclius said, 'What does he order you to do?'\n         I said, 'He tells us to worship Allah and Allah alone and not to \n          worship anything along with Him, and to renounce all that our \n          ancestors had said. He orders us to pray, to speak the truth, to be \n          chaste and to keep good relations with our Kith and kin.'\n         Heraclius asked the translator to convey to me the following, I asked \n          you about his family and your reply was that he belonged to a very \n          noble family. In fact all the Apostles come from noble families \n          amongst their respective peoples. I questioned you whether anybody \n          else amongst you claimed such a thing, your reply was in the negative.\n          If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that \n          this man was following the previous man's statement. Then I asked you \n          whether anyone of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the \n          negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought \n          that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom.\n         I further asked whether he was ever accused of telling lies before he \n          said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. So I wondered \n          how a person who does not tell a lie about others could ever tell a \n          lie about Allah. I, then asked you whether the rich people followed \n          him or the poor. You replied that it was the poor who followed him. \n          And in fact all the Apostle have been followed by this very class of \n          people. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or \n          decreasing. You replied that they were increasing, and in fact this is\n          the way of true faith, till it is complete in all respects. I further \n          asked you whether there was anybody, who, after embracing his \n          religion, became displeased and discarded his religion. Your reply was\n          in the negative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when \n          its delight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. I asked \n          you whether he had ever betrayed. You replied in the negative and \n          likewise the Apostles never betray. Then I asked you what he ordered \n          you to do. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allah and Allah \n          alone and not to worship any thing along with Him and forbade you to \n          worship idols and ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be \n          chaste. If what you have said is true, he will very soon occupy this \n          place underneath my feet and I knew it (from the scriptures) that he \n          was going to appear but I did not know that he would be from you, and \n          if I could reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet him \n          and if I were with him, I would certainly wash his feet.' Heraclius \n          then asked for the letter addressed by Allah's Apostle\n         which was delivered by Dihya to the Governor of Busra, who forwarded \n          it to Heraclius to read. The contents of the letter were as follows: \n          \"In the name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful (This letter is) \n          from Muhammad the slave of Allah and His Apostle to Heraclius the \n          ruler of Byzantine. Peace be upon him, who follows the right path. \n          Furthermore I invite you to Islam, and if you become a Muslim you will\n          be safe, and Allah will double your reward, and if you reject this \n          invitation of Islam you will be committing a sin by misguiding your \n          Arisiyin (peasants). (And I recite to you Allah's Statement:)\n         'O people of the scripture! Come to a word common to you and us that \n          we worship none but Allah and that we associate nothing in worship \n          with Him, and that none of us shall take others as Lords beside Allah.\n          Then, if they turn away, say: Bear witness that we are Muslims (those \n          who have surrendered to Allah).' (3:64).\n         Abu Sufyan then added, \"When Heraclius had finished his speech and had\n          read the letter, there was a great hue and cry in the Royal Court. So \n          we were turned out of the court. I told my companions that the \n          question of Ibn-Abi-Kabsha) (the Prophet Muhammad) has become so \n          prominent that even the King of Bani Al-Asfar (Byzantine) is afraid of\n          him. Then I started to become sure that he (the Prophet) would be the \n          conqueror in the near future till I embraced Islam (i.e. Allah guided \n          me to it).\"\n         The sub narrator adds, \"Ibn An-Natur was the Governor of llya' \n          (Jerusalem) and Heraclius was the head of the Christians of Sham. Ibn \n          An-Natur narrates that once while Heraclius was visiting ilya' \n          (Jerusalem), he got up in the morning with a sad mood. Some of his \n          priests asked him why he was in that mood? Heraclius was a foreteller \n          and an astrologer. He replied, 'At night when I looked at the stars, I\n          saw that the leader of those who practice circumcision had appeared \n          (become the conqueror). Who are they who practice circumcision?' The \n          people replied, 'Except the Jews nobody practices circumcision, so you\n          should not be afraid of them (Jews).\n         'Just Issue orders to kill every Jew present in the country.'\n         While they were discussing it, a messenger sent by the king of Ghassan\n          to convey the news of Allah's Apostle to Heraclius was brought in. \n          Having heard the news, he (Heraclius) ordered the people to go and see\n          whether the messenger of Ghassan was circumcised. The people, after \n          seeing him, told Heraclius that he was circumcised. Heraclius then \n          asked him about the Arabs. The messenger replied, 'Arabs also practice\n          circumcision.'\n         (After hearing that) Heraclius remarked that sovereignty of the 'Arabs\n          had appeared. Heraclius then wrote a letter to his friend in Rome who \n          was as good as Heraclius in knowledge. Heraclius then left for Homs. \n          (a town in Syrian and stayed there till he received the reply of his \n          letter from his friend who agreed with him in his opinion about the \n          emergence of the Prophet and the fact that he was a Prophet. On that \n          Heraclius invited all the heads of the Byzantines to assemble in his \n          palace at Homs. When they assembled, he ordered that all the doors of \n          his palace be closed. Then he came out and said, 'O Byzantines! If \n          success is your desire and if you seek right guidance and want your \n          empire to remain then give a pledge of allegiance to this Prophet \n          (i.e. embrace Islam).'\n         (On hearing the views of Heraclius) the people ran towards the gates \n          of the palace like onagers but found the doors closed. Heraclius \n          realized their hatred towards Islam and when he lost the hope of their\n          embracing Islam, he ordered that they should be brought back in \n          audience.\n         (When they returned) he said, 'What already said was just to test the \n          strength of your conviction and I have seen it.' The people prostrated\n          before him and became pleased with him, and this was the end of \n          Heraclius's story (in connection with his faith).\n                \n      "}]},{"name":" Belief ","hadiths":[{"id":6,"hadith":" Narrated Ibn 'Umar:\n         Allah's Apostle said: Islam is based on (the following) five \n          (principles):\n         1.

Then they found \n          there a wall on the point of collapsing. Al-Khadir repaired it with \n          his own hands.

Then when Allah had finished from the Judgments \n          amongst his creations, one man will be left between Hell and Paradise \n          and he will be the last man from the people of Hell to enter paradise.\n          He will be facing Hell, and will say, 'O Allah! Turn my face from the \n          fire as its wind has dried me and its steam has burnt me.' Allah will \n          ask him, \"Will you ask for anything more in case this favor is granted\n          to you?' He will say, \"No by Your (Honor) Power!\" And he will give to \n          his Lord (Allah) what he will of the pledges and the covenants. Allah \n          will then turn his face from the Fire. When he will face Paradise and \n          will see its charm, he will remain quiet as long as Allah will. He \n          then will say, 'O my Lord! Let me go to the gate of Paradise.' Allah \n          will ask him, 'Didn't you give pledges and make covenants (to the \n          effect) that you would not ask for anything more than what you \n          requested at first?' He will say, 'O my Lord! Do not make me the most \n          wretched, amongst Your creatures.' Allah will say, 'If this request is\n          granted, will you then ask for anything else?' He will say, 'No! By \n          Your Power! I shall not ask for anything else.' Then he will give to \n          his Lord what He will of the pledges and the covenants. Allah will \n          then let him go to the gate of Paradise. On reaching then and seeing \n          its life, charm, and pleasure, he will remain quiet as long as Allah \n          wills and then will say, 'O my Lord ! Let me enter Paradise.' Allah \n          will say, May Allah be merciful unto you, O son of Adam! How \n          treacherous you are! Haven't you made covenants and given pledges that\n          you will not ask for anything more that what you have been given?' He \n          will say, 'O my Lord! Do not make me the most wretched amongst Your \n          creatures.' So Allah will laugh and allow him to enter Paradise and \n          will ask him to request as much as he likes. He will do so till all \n          his desires have been fulfilled . Then Allah will say, 'Request more \n          of such and such things.'

But in fact, this divine inspiration was revealed \n            concerning the Ansar who used to assume lhram for worship ping an idol\n            called \"Manat\" which they used to worship at a place called \n            Al-Mushallal before they embraced Islam, and whoever assumed Ihram \n            (for the idol), would consider it not right to perform Tawaf between \n            Safa and Marwa. \n           When they embraced Islam, they asked Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) \n            regarding it, saying, \"O Allah's Apostle! We used to refrain from \n            Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.\" So Allah revealed: 'Verily; (the \n            mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah.' \" \n            Aisha added, \"Surely, Allah's Apostle set the tradition of Tawaf \n            between Safa and Marwa, so nobody is allowed to omit the Tawaf between\n            them.\" Later on I ('Urwa) told Abu Bakr bin 'Abdur-Rahman (of 'Aisha's\n            narration) and he said, 'i have not heard of such information, but I \n            heard learned men saying that all the people, except those whom 'Aisha\n            mentioned and who used to assume lhram for the sake of Manat, used to \n            perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. \n           When Allah referred to the Tawaf of the Ka'ba and did not mention Safa\n            and Marwa in the Quran, the people asked, 'O Allah's Apostle! We used \n            to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa and Allah has revealed (the \n            verses concerning) Tawaf of the Ka'ba and has not mentioned Safa and \n            Marwa. Is there any harm if we perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa?' \n            So Allah revealed: \"Verily As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols \n            of Allah.\" Abu Bakr said, \"It seems that this verse was revealed \n            concerning the two groups, those who used to refrain from Tawaf \n            between Safa and Marwa in the Pre-lslamic Period of ignorance and \n            those who used to perform the Tawaf then, and after embracing Islam \n            they refrained from the Tawaf between them as Allah had enjoined Tawaf\n            of the Ka'ba and did not mention Tawaf (of Safa and Marwa) till later \n            after mentioning the Tawaf of the Ka'ba.'  \n        "},{"id":1416,"hadith":" Narrated Nafi':\n           Ibn 'Umar said, \"When Allah's Apostle performed the first Tawaf he did\n            Ramal in the first three rounds and then walked in the remaining four \n            rounds (of Tawaf of the Ka'ba), where as in performing Tawaf between \n            Safa and Marwa he used to run in the midst of the rain-water passage,\"\n            I asked Nafi', \"Did 'Abdullah (bin 'Umar) use to walk steadily on \n            reaching the Yemenite Corner?\" He replied, \"No, unless people were \n            crowded at the Corner; otherwise he would not leave it without \n            touching it.\"  \n        "},{"id":1417,"hadith":" Narrated 'Amr bin Dinar:\n           We asked Ibn 'Umar whether a man who, while performing 'Umra, had \n            performed Tawaf of the Ka'ba; and had not yet performed Tawaf between \n            Safa and Marwa, could have sexual relation with his wife, Ibn 'Umar \n            replied \"The Prophet (p.b.u.h) reached Mecca and performed the seven \n            rounds (of Tawaf) of the Ka'ba and then offered a two-Rakat prayer \n            behind Maqam ibrahim and then performed the seven rounds (of Tawaf) \n            between Safa and Marwa.\" He added, \"Verily!

Then I dressed myself and went to Hafsa \n          and asked her, 'Does any of you keep Allah's Apostle angry all the day\n          long till night?' She replied in the affirmative. I said, 'She is a \n          ruined losing person (and will never have success)! Doesn't she fear \n          that Allah may get angry for the anger of Allah's Apostle and thus she\n          will be ruined?

My companion went (to \n          the Prophet on the day of his turn, went and returned to us at night \n          and knocked at my door violently, asking whether I was sleeping. I was\n          scared (by the hard knocking) and came out to him. He said that a \n          great thing had happened. I asked him: What is it? Have Ghassan come? \n          He replied that it was worse and more serious than that, and added \n          that Allah's Apostle had divorced all his wives. I said, Hafsa is a \n          ruined loser! I expected that would happen some day.' So I dressed \n          myself and offered the Fajr prayer with the Prophet. Then the Prophet \n          entered an upper room and stayed there alone. I went to Hafsa and \n          found her weeping. I asked her, 'Why are you weeping? Didn't I warn \n          you? Have Allah's Apostle divorced you all?' She replied, 'I don't \n          know. He is there in the upper room.' I then went out and came to the \n          pulpit and found a group of people around it and some of them were \n          weeping. Then I sat with them for some time, but could not endure the \n          situation. So I went to the upper room where the Prophet was and \n          requested to a black slave of his: \"Will you get the permission of \n          (Allah's Apostle) for Umar (to enter)? The slave went in, talked to \n          the Prophet about it and came out saying, 'I mentioned you to him but \n          he did not reply.' So, I went and sat with the people who were sitting\n          by the pulpit, but I could not bear the situation, so I went to  the \n          slave again and said: \"Will you get  he permission for Umar?

When I was leaving, behold, \n          the slave called me saying, \"Allah's Apostle has granted you \n          permission.\" So, I entered upon the Prophet and saw him lying on a mat\n          without wedding on it, and the mat had left its mark on the body of \n          the Prophet, and he was leaning on a leather pillow stuffed with palm \n          fires. I greeted him and while still standing, I said: \"Have you \n          divorced your wives?' He raised his eyes to me and replied in the \n          negative. And then while still standing, I said chatting: \"Will you \n          heed what I say, 'O Allah's Apostle!

The \n          Prophet smiled again. When I saw him smiling, I sat down and cast a \n          glance at the room, and by Allah, I couldn't see anything of \n          importance but three hides. I said (to Allah's Apostle) \"Invoke Allah \n          to make your followers prosperous for the Persians and the Byzantines \n          have been made prosperous and given worldly luxuries, though they do \n          not worship Allah?' The Prophet was leaning then (and on hearing my \n          speech he sat straight) and said, 'O Ibn Al-Khatttab! Do you have any \n          doubt (that the Hereafter is better than this world)? These people \n          have been given rewards of their good deeds in this world only.' I \n          asked the Prophet . 'Please ask Allah's forgiveness for me. The \n          Prophet did not go to his wives because of the secret which Hafsa had \n          disclosed to 'Aisha, and he said that he would not go to his wives for\n          one month as he was angry with them when Allah admonished him (for his\n          oath that he would not approach Maria). When twenty-nine days had \n          passed, the Prophet went to Aisha first of all. She said to him, 'You \n          took an oath that you would not come to us for one month, and today \n          only twenty-nine days have passed, as I have been counting them day by\n          day.' The Prophet said, 'The month is also of twenty-nine days.' That \n          month consisted of twenty-nine days. 'Aisha said, 'When the Divine \n          revelation of Choice was revealed, the Prophet started with me, saying\n          to me, 'I am telling you something, but you needn't hurry to give the \n          reply till you can consult your parents.\" 'Aisha knew that her parents\n          would not advise her to part with the Prophet .

During a Ghazwa of his, he drew \n          lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him \n          after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in\n          a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allah's\n          Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we \n          approached the city of Medina, Allah's Apostle ordered us to proceed \n          at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was\n          past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned\n          (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that \n          my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it \n          and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on \n          the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, \n          thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in \n          weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those \n          people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah \n          while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a\n          young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my \n          necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find \n          nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that \n          they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in \n          that state, I felt sleepy and slept.\n         Safwan bin Mu'attal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and \n          reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he \n          came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I \n          heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for \n          Allah, and we will return to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He \n          got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the \n          camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading\n          the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take \n          rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into \n          destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the \n          false accusers was 'Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we \n          returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people \n          were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was \n          feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual \n          kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got \n          sick. But he would come, greet and say, 'How is that (girl)?' I did \n          not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my \n          ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to \n          answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of\n          nature except from night to night and that was before we had \n          lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to \n          the habit of the old 'Arabs in the open country (or away from houses).\n          So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled \n          because of her long dress and on that she said, 'Let Mistah be \n          ruined.' I said, 'You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man\n          who took part in (the battle of) Badr?' She said, 'O Hanata (you \n          there) didn't you hear what they said?' Then she told me the rumors of\n          the false accusers. \n         My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allah's Apostle \n          came to me, and after greeting he said, 'How is that (girl)?' I \n          requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be \n          sure of the news through them I Allah's Apostle allowed me, and I went\n          to my parents and asked my mother, 'What are the people talking \n          about?' She said, 'O my daughter! Don't worry much about this matter. \n          By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has\n          other wives, but the women would forge false news about her.' I said, \n          'Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter?' \n          That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the \n          morning Allah's Apostle called Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid \n          when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about \n          divorcing his wife (i.e. 'Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of \n          the good reputation of his wives and added, 'O Allah's Apostle! Keep \n          you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good.' 'Ali bin\n          Abu Talib said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions \n          on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the \n          woman-servant who will tell you the truth.' On that Allah's Apostle \n          called Buraira and said, 'O Burair. Did you ever see anything which \n          roused your suspicions about her?' Buraira said, 'No, by Allah Who has\n          sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty \n          except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and \n          leaves the dough for the goats to eat.' On that day Allah's Apostle \n          ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in \n          punishing 'Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allah's Apostle said, 'Who \n          will support me to punish that person ('Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) \n          who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I\n          know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person \n          about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house \n          except in my company.'\n         Sad bin Mu'adh got up and said, 'O Allah's Apostle! by Allah, I will \n          relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then \n          we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the \n          Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order.' On that Sad \n          bin 'Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had \n          been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and \n          said, 'By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you \n          will never be able to kill him.' On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and\n          said (to Sad bin 'Ubada), 'By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will\n          kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites.' On this \n          the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight \n          each other, while Allah's Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got \n          down and quietened them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On \n          that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, \n          nor could I sleep.\n         In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights \n          and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While \n          they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my \n          permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and \n          started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allah's Apostle \n          came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they \n          forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for\n          a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be \n          worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, 'O \n          'Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are \n          innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have \n          committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for \n          when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah \n          accepts his repentance.' When Allah's Apostle finished his speech my \n          tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of \n          it. I requested my father to reply to Allah's Apostle on my behalf. My\n          father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Apostle.' \n          I said to my mother, 'Talk to Allah's Apostle on my behalf.' She said,\n          'By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Apostle.\n         I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I \n          said. 'I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are \n          saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it \n          as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that\n          I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you \n          falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would\n          believe me. By Allah, I don't compare my situation with you except to \n          the situation of Joseph's father (i.e. Jacob) who said, 'So (for me) \n          patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah\n          (Alone) whose help can be sought.' Then I turned to the other side of \n          my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never \n          thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I \n          considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Qur'an. I \n          had hoped that Allah's Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would\n          prove my innocence. By Allah, Allah's Apostle had not got up and \n          nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to \n          Allah's Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to \n          overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He \n          was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like\n          pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allah's \n          Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, 'Aisha! \n          Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence.' My mother told me\n          to go to Allah's Apostle . I replied, 'By Allah I will not go to him \n          and will not thank but Allah.' So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who \n          spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) \n         When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to\n          provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, 'By \n          Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he \n          said about Aisha.' But Allah later revealed: --\n         \"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to \n          help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in \n          Allah's Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that \n          Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most \n          Merciful.\"  (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, 'Yes ! By Allah! I like \n          that Allah should forgive me,' and resumed helping Mistah whom he used\n          to help before. \n         Allah's Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophet's wife \n          about me saying, 'What do you know and what did you see?' She replied,\n          'O Allah's Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have \n          not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about \n          Aisha.\" Aisha further added \"Zainab was competing with me (in her \n          beauty and the Prophet's love), yet Allah protected her (from being \n          malicious), for she had piety.\"\n                \n      "},{"id":2364,"hadith":" Narrated Abu Bakra:\n         A man praised another man in front of the Prophet .

The Prophet \n            changed his way till he dismounted at the farthest end of Al-Hudaibiya\n            at a pit (i.e. well) containing a little water which the people used \n            in small amounts, and in a short while the people used up all its \n            water and complained to Allah's Apostle; of thirst. The Prophet took \n            an arrow out of his arrow-case and ordered them to put the arrow in \n            that pit. By Allah, the water started and continued sprouting out till\n            all the people quenched their thirst and returned with satisfaction. \n            While they were still in that state, Budail bin Warqa-al-Khuza'i came \n            with some persons from his tribe Khuza'a and they were the advisers of\n            Allah's Apostle who would keep no secret from him and were from the \n            people of Tihama. Budail said, \"I left Kab bin Luai and 'Amir bin Luai\n            residing at the profuse water of Al-Hudaibiya and they had milch \n            camels (or their women and children) with them, and will wage war \n            against you, and will prevent you from visiting the Kaba.\" Allah's \n            Apostle said, \"We have not come to fight anyone, but to perform the \n            'Umra. No doubt, the war has weakened Quraish and they have suffered \n            great losses, so if they wish, I will conclude a truce with them, \n            during which they should refrain from interfering between me and the \n            people (i.e. the 'Arab infidels other than Quraish), and if I have \n            victory over those infidels, Quraish will have the option to embrace \n            Islam as the other people do, if they wish; they will at least get \n            strong enough to fight. But if they do not accept the truce, by Allah \n            in Whose Hands my life is, I will fight with them defending my Cause \n            till I get killed, but (I am sure) Allah will definitely make His \n            Cause victorious.\" Budail said, \"I will inform them of what you have \n            said.\" So, he set off till he reached Quraish and said, \"We have come \n            from that man (i.e. Muhammad) whom we heard saying something which we \n            will disclose to you if you should like.\" Some of the fools among \n            Quraish shouted that they were not in need of this information, but \n            the wiser among them said, \"Relate what you heard him saying.\" Budail \n            said, \"I heard him saying so-and-so,\" relating what the Prophet had \n            told him.\n           Urwa bin Mas'ud got up and said, \"O people! Aren't you the sons? They \n            said, \"Yes.\" He added, \"Am I not the father?\" They said, \"Yes.\" He \n            said, \"Do you mistrust me?\" They said, \"No.\" He said, \"Don't you know \n            that I invited the people of 'Ukaz for your help, and when they \n            refused I brought my relatives and children and those who obeyed me \n            (to help you)?\" They said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Well, this man (i.e. the \n            Prophet) has offered you a reasonable proposal, you'd better accept it\n            and allow me to meet him.\" They said, \"You may meet him.\" So, he went \n            to the Prophet and started talking to him. The Prophet told him almost\n            the same as he had told Budail. Then Urwa said, \"O Muhammad! Won't you\n            feel any scruple in extirpating your relations? Have you ever heard of\n            anyone amongst the Arabs extirpating his relatives before you? On the \n            other hand, if the reverse should happen, (nobody will aid you, for) \n            by Allah, I do not see (with you) dignified people, but people from \n            various tribes who would run away leaving you alone.\" Hearing that, \n            Abu Bakr abused him and said, \"Do you say we would run and leave the \n            Prophet alone?\" Urwa said, \"Who is that man?\" They said, \"He is Abu \n            Bakr.\" Urwa said to Abu Bakr, \"By Him in Whose Hands my life is, were \n            it not for the favor which you did to me and which I did not \n            compensate, I would retort on you.\" Urwa kept on talking to the \n            Prophet and seizing the Prophet's beard as he was talking while \n            Al-Mughira bin Shu'ba was standing near the head of the Prophet, \n            holding a sword and wearing a helmet. Whenever Urwa stretched his hand\n            towards the beard of the Prophet, Al-Mughira would hit his hand with \n            the handle of the sword and say (to Urwa), \"Remove your hand from the \n            beard of Allah's Apostle.\" Urwa raised his head and asked, \"Who is \n            that?\" The people said, \"He is Al-Mughira bin Shu'ba.\" Urwa said, \"O \n            treacherous! Am I not doing my best to prevent evil consequences of \n            your treachery?\" \n           Before embracing Islam Al-Mughira was in the company of some people. \n            He killed them and took their property and came (to Medina) to embrace\n            Islam. The Prophet said (to him, \"As regards your Islam, I accept it, \n            but as for the property I do not take anything of it. (As it was taken\n            through treason). Urwa then started looking at the Companions of the \n            Prophet. By Allah, whenever Allah's Apostle spat, the spittle would \n            fall in the hand of one of them (i.e. the Prophet's companions) who \n            would rub it on his face and skin; if he ordered them they would carry\n            his orders immediately; if he performed ablution, they would struggle \n            to take the remaining water; and when they spoke to him, they would \n            lower their voices and would not look at his face constantly out of \n            respect. Urwa returned to his people and said, \"O people! By Allah, I \n            have been to the kings and to Caesar, Khosrau and An-Najashi, yet I \n            have never seen any of them respected by his courtiers as much as \n            Muhammad is respected by his companions. By Allah, if he spat, the \n            spittle would fall in the hand of one of them (i.e. the Prophet's \n            companions) who would rub it on his face and skin; if he ordered them,\n            they would carry out his order immediately; if he performed ablution, \n            they would struggle to take the remaining water; and when they spoke, \n            they would lower their voices and would not look at his face \n            constantly out of respect.\" Urwa added, \"No doubt, he has presented to\n            you a good reasonable offer, so please accept it.\" A man from the \n            tribe of Bani Kinana said, \"Allow me to go to him,\" and they allowed \n            him, and when he approached the Prophet and his companions, Allah's Ap\n            le I said, \"He is so-and-so who belongs to the tribe that respects the\n            Budn (i.e. camels of the sacrifice). So, bring the Budn in front of \n            him.\" So, the Budn were brought before him and the people received him\n            while they were reciting Talbiya. When he saw that scene, he said, \n            \"Glorified be Allah! It is not fair to prevent these people from \n            visiting the Ka'ba.\" When he returned to his people, he said, 'I saw \n            the Budn garlanded (with colored knotted ropes) and marked (with stabs\n            on their backs). I do not think it is advisable to prevent them from \n            visiting the Ka'ba.\" Another person called Mikraz bin Hafs got up and \n            sought their permission to go to Muhammad, and they allowed him, too. \n            When he approached the Muslims, the Prophet said, \"Here is Mikraz and \n            he is a vicious man.\" Mikraz started talking to the Prophet and as he \n            was talking, Suhail bin Amr came. \n           When Suhail bin Amr came, the Prophet said, \"Now the matter has become\n            easy.\" Suhail said to the Prophet \"Please conclude a peace treaty with\n            us.\" So, the Prophet called the clerk and said to him, \"Write: By the \n            Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful.\" Suhail said, \n            \"As for 'Beneficent,' by Allah, I do not know what it means. So write:\n            By Your Name O Allah, as you used to write previously.\" The Muslims \n            said, \"By Allah, we will not write except: By the Name of Allah, the \n            most Beneficent, the most Merciful.\" The Prophet said, \"Write: By Your\n            Name O Allah.\" Then he dictated, \"This is the peace treaty which \n            Muhammad, Allah's Apostle has concluded.\" Suhail said, \"By Allah, if \n            we knew that you are Allah's Apostle we would not prevent you from \n            visiting the Kaba, and would not fight with you. So, write: \"Muhammad \n            bin Abdullah.\" The Prophet said, \"By Allah! I am Apostle of Allah even\n            if you people do not believe me. Write: Muhammad bin Abdullah.\" \n            (Az-Zuhri said, \"The Prophet accepted all those things, as he had \n            already said that he would accept everything they would demand if it \n            respects the ordinance of Allah, (i.e. by letting him and his \n            companions perform 'Umra.)\" The Prophet said to Suhail, \"On the \n            condition that you allow us to visit the House (i.e. Ka'ba) so that we\n            may perform Tawaf around it.\" Suhail said, \"By Allah, we will not \n            (allow you this year) so as not to give chance to the 'Arabs to say \n            that we have yielded to you, but we will allow you next year.\" So, the\n            Prophet got that written. \n           Then Suhail said, \"We also stipulate that you should return to us \n            whoever comes to you from us, even if he embraced your religion.\" The \n            Muslims said, \"Glorified be Allah! How will such a person be returned \n            to the pagans after he has become a Muslim? While they were in this \n            state Abu- Jandal bin Suhail bin 'Amr came from the valley of Mecca \n            staggering with his fetters and fell down amongst the Muslims. Suhail \n            said, \"O Muhammad! This is the very first term with which we make \n            peace with you, i.e. you shall return Abu Jandal to me.\" The Prophet \n            said, \"The peace treaty has not been written yet.\" Suhail said, \"I \n            will never allow you to keep him.\" The Prophet said, \"Yes, do.\" He \n            said, \"I won't do.: Mikraz said, \"We allow you (to keep him).\" Abu \n            Jandal said, \"O Muslims! Will I be returned to the pagans though I \n            have come as a Muslim? Don't you see how much I have suffered?\" \n           Abu Jandal had been tortured severely for the Cause of Allah. Umar bin\n            Al-Khattab said, \"I went to the Prophet and said, 'Aren't you truly \n            the Apostle of Allah?' The Prophet said, 'Yes, indeed.' I said, 'Isn't\n            our Cause just and the cause of the enemy unjust?' He said, 'Yes.' I \n            said, 'Then why should we be humble in our religion?' He said, 'I am \n            Allah's Apostle and I do not disobey Him, and He will make me \n            victorious.' I said, 'Didn't you tell us that we would go to the Ka'ba\n            and perform Tawaf around it?' He said, 'Yes, but did I tell you that \n            we would visit the Ka'ba this year?' I said, 'No.' He said, 'So you \n            will visit it and perform Tawaf around it?' \" Umar further said, \"I \n            went to Abu Bakr and said, 'O Abu Bakr! Isn't he truly Allah's \n            Prophet?' He replied, 'Yes.' I said, 'Then why should we be humble in \n            our religion?' He said, 'Indeed, he is Allah's Apostle and he does not\n            disobey his Lord, and He will make him victorious. Adhere to him as, \n            by Allah, he is on the right.' I said, 'Was he not telling us that we \n            would go to the Kaba and perform Tawaf around it?' He said, 'Yes, but \n            did he tell you that you would go to the Ka'ba this year?' I said, \n            'No.' He said, \"You will go to Ka'ba and perform Tawaf around it.\" \n            (Az-Zuhri said, \" 'Umar said, 'I performed many good deeds as \n            expiation for the improper questions I asked them.' \") \n           When the writing of the peace treaty was concluded, Allah's Apostle \n            said to his companions, \"Get up and' slaughter your sacrifices and get\n            your head shaved.\" By Allah none of them got up, and the Prophet \n            repeated his order thrice. When none of them got up, he left them and \n            went to Um Salama and told her of the people's attitudes towards him. \n            Um Salama said, \"O the Prophet of Allah! Do you want your order to be \n            carried out? Go out and don't say a word to anybody till you have \n            slaughtered your sacrifice and call your barber to shave your head.\" \n            So, the Prophet went out and did not talk to anyone of them till he \n            did that, i.e. slaughtered the sacrifice and called his barber who \n            shaved his head. Seeing that, the companions of the Prophet got up, \n            slaughtered their sacrifices, and started shaving the heads of one \n            another, and there was so much rush that there was a danger of killing\n            each other. Then some believing women came (to the Prophet ); and \n            Allah revealed the following Divine Verses:--\n           \"O you who believe, when the believing women come to you as emigrants \n            examine them . . .\" (60.10)\n           Umar then divorced two wives of his who were infidels. Later on \n            Muawiya bin Abu Sufyan married one of them, and Safwan bin Umaya \n            married the other. When the Prophet returned to Medina, Abu Basir, a \n            new Muslim convert from Quraish came to him. The Infidels sent in his \n            pursuit two men who said (to the Prophet ), \"Abide by the promise you \n            gave us.\" So, the Prophet handed him over to them. They took him out \n            (of the City) till they reached Dhul-Hulaifa where they dismounted to \n            eat some dates they had with them. Abu Basir said to one of them, \"By \n            Allah, O so-and-so, I see you have a fine sword.\" The other drew it \n            out (of the scabbard) and said, \"By Allah, it is very fine and I have \n            tried it many times.\" Abu Bair said, \"Let me have a look at it.\" \n           When the other gave it to him, he hit him with it till he died, and \n            his companion ran away till he came to Medina and entered the Mosque \n            running. When Allah's Apostle saw him he said, \"This man appears to \n            have been frightened.\" When he reached the Prophet he said, \"My \n            companion has been murdered and I would have been murdered too.\" Abu \n            Basir came and said, \"O Allah's Apostle, by Allah, Allah has made you \n            fulfill your obligations by your returning me to them (i.e. the \n            Infidels), but Allah has saved me from them.\" The Prophet said, \"Woe \n            to his mother! what excellent war kindler he would be, should he only \n            have supporters.\" When Abu Basir heard that he understood that the \n            Prophet would return him to them again, so he set off till he reached \n            the seashore. Abu Jandal bin Suhail got himself released from them \n            (i.e. infidels) and joined Abu Basir. So, whenever a man from Quraish \n            embraced Islam he would follow Abu Basir till they formed a strong \n            group. By Allah, whenever they heard about a caravan of Quraish \n            heading towards Sham, they stopped it and attacked and killed them \n            (i.e. infidels) and took their properties. The people of Quraish sent \n            a message to the Prophet requesting him for the Sake of Allah and Kith\n            and kin to send for (i.e. Abu Basir and his companions) promising that\n            whoever (amongst them) came to the Prophet would be secure. So the \n            Prophet sent for them (i.e. Abu Basir's companions) and Allah I \n            revealed the following Divine Verses:\n           \"And it is He Who Has withheld their hands from you and your hands \n            From them in the midst of Mecca, After He made you the victorious over\n            them. . . . the unbelievers had pride and haughtiness, in their hearts\n            . . . the pride and haughtiness of the time of ignorance.\"  (48.24-26)\n            And their pride and haughtiness was that they did not confess (write \n            in the treaty) that he (i.e. Muhammad) was the Prophet of Allah and \n            refused to write: \"In the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the Most\n            Merciful,\" and prevented the Mushriks from visiting the Ka'ba.\n           Narrated Az-Zuhri: Urwa said, \"Aisha told me that Allah's Apostle used\n            to examine the women emigrants. We have been told also that when Allah\n            revealed the order that the Muslims should return to the pagans what \n            they had spent on their wives who emigrated (after embracing Islam) \n            and that the Mushriks should not. keep unbelieving women as their \n            wives, 'Umar divorced two of his wives, Qariba, the daughter of Abu \n            Urhaiya and the daughter of Jarwal Al-Khuza'i. Later on Mu'awlya \n            married Qariba and Abu Jahm married the other.\"\n           When the pagans refused to pay what the Muslims had spent on their \n            wives, Allah revealed: \"And if any of your wives have gone from you to\n            the unbelievers and you have an accession (By the coming over of a \n            woman from the other side) (Then pay to those whose wives have gone) \n            The equivalent of what they had spent (On their Mahr).\" (60.11)\n           So, Allah ordered that the Muslim whose wife, has gone, should be \n            given, as a compensation of the Mahr he had given to his wife, from \n            the Mahr of the wives of the pagans who had emigrated deserting their \n            husbands.\n           We do not know any of the women emigrants who deserted Islam after \n            embracing it. We have also been told that Abu Basir bin Asid \n            Ath-Thaqafi came to the Prophet as a Muslim emigrant during the truce.\n            Al-Akhnas bin Shariq wrote to the Prophet requesting him to return Abu\n            Basir. \n        "},{"id":2426,"hadith":" Narrated Abu Huraira:\n           Allah's Apostle mentioned a person who asked an Israeli man to lend \n            him one-thousand Dinars, and the Israeli lent him the sum for a \n            certain fixed period. \n        "},{"id":2427,"hadith":" Narrated Amra:\n           Aisha  said that Buraira came to seek her help in the writing of her \n            emancipation.

I replied, 'The result was unstable; sometimes\n          he was victorious and sometimes we.' He said, 'What does he order you \n          to do?'

He orders us to pray, give in charity, be chaste, \n          keep promises and return what is entrusted to us.' When I had said \n          that, Caesar said to his translator, 'Say to him: I ask you about his \n          lineage and your reply was that he belonged to a noble family. In \n          fact, all the apostles came from the noblest lineage of their nations.\n          Then I questioned you whether anybody else amongst you had claimed \n          such a thing, and your reply was in the negative. If the answer had \n          been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man was \n          following a claim that had been said before him. When I asked you \n          whether he was ever blamed for telling lies, your reply was in the \n          negative, so I took it for granted that a person who did not tell a \n          lie about (others) the people could never tell a lie about Allah. Then\n          I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in\n          the negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have \n          thought that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom. When \n          I asked you whether the rich or the poor people followed him, you \n          replied that it was the poor who followed him. In fact, such are the \n          followers of the apostles. Then I asked you whether his followers were\n          increasing or decreasing. You replied that they were increasing. In \n          fact, this is the result of true faith till it is complete (in all \n          respects). I asked you whether there was anybody who, after embracing \n          his religion, became displeased and discarded his religion; your reply\n          was in the negative. In fact, this is the sign of true faith, for when\n          its cheerfulness enters and mixes in the hearts completely, nobody \n          will be displeased with it. I asked you whether he had ever broken his\n          promise. You replied in the negative. And such are the apostles; they \n          never break their promises. When I asked you whether you fought with \n          him and he fought with you, you replied that he did, and that \n          sometimes he was victorious and sometimes you. Indeed, such are the \n          apostles; they are put to trials and the final victory is always \n          theirs. Then I asked you what he ordered you. You replied that he \n          ordered you to worship Allah alone and not to worship others along \n          with Him, to leave all that your fore-fathers used to worship, to \n          offer prayers, to speak the truth, to be chaste, to keep promises, and\n          to return what is entrusted to you. These are really the qualities of \n          a prophet who, I knew (from the previous Scriptures) would appear, but\n          I did not know that he would be from amongst you. If what you say \n          should be true, he will very soon occupy the earth under my feet, and \n          if I knew that I would reach him definitely, I would go immediately to\n          meet Him; and were I with him, then I would certainly wash his feet.' \n          \" Abu Sufyan added, \"Caesar then asked for the letter of Allah's \n          Apostle and it was read.

He said, 'I will do,' I said to him, 'We have heard that a \n            person has appeared here, claiming to be a Prophet. I sent my brother \n            to speak to him and when he returned, he did not bring a satisfactory \n            report; so I thought of meeting him personally.' 'Ali said (to Abu \n            Dhar), 'You have reached your goal; I am going to him just now, so \n            follow me, and wherever I enter, enter after me. If I should see \n            someone who may cause you trouble, I will stand near a wall pretending\n            to mend my shoes (as a warning), and you should go away then.' 'Ali \n            proceeded and I accompanied him till he entered a place, and I entered\n            with him to the Prophet to whom I said, 'Present (the principles of) \n            Islam to me.'

Keep your conversion as a secret and return to your \n            town; and when you hear of our victory, return to us. ' I said, 'By H \n            him Who has sent you with the Truth, I will announce my conversion to \n            Islam publicly amongst them (i.e. the infidels),' Abu Dhar went to the\n            Mosque, where some people from Quraish were present, and said, 'O folk\n            of Quraish ! I testify that None has the right to be worshipped except\n            Allah, and I (also) testify that Muhammad is Allah's Slave and His \n            Apostle.' (Hearing that) the Quraishi men said, 'Get at this Sabi \n            (i.e. Muslim) !' They got up and beat me nearly to death. Al 'Abbas \n            saw me and threw himself over me to protect me. He then faced them and\n            said, 'Woe to you! You want to kill a man from the tribe of Ghifar, \n            although your trade and your communications are through the territory \n            of Ghifar?' They therefore left me. The next morning I returned (to \n            the Mosque) and said the same as I have said on the previous day. They\n            again said, 'Get at this Sabi!'

'Umar said, \"If the \n            property of 'Umar's family covers the debt, then pay the debt thereof;\n            otherwise request it from Bani 'Adi bin Ka'b, and if that too is not \n            sufficient, ask for it from Quraish tribe, and do not ask for it from \n            any one else, and pay this debt on my behalf.\" \n           'Umar then said (to 'Abdullah), \"Go to 'Aisha (the mother of the \n            believers) and say: \"Umar is paying his salutation to you. But don't \n            say: 'The chief of the believers,' because today I am not the chief of\n            the believers.

He said to her,\n            \"'Umar bin Al-Khattab is paying his salutations to you, and asks the \n            permission to be buried with his two companions.\" She said, \"I had the\n            idea of having this place for myself, but today I prefer Umar to \n            myself.\" When he returned it was said (to 'Umar), \"'Abdullah bin 'Umar\n            has come.\" 'Umar said, \"Make me sit up.\" Somebody supported him \n            against his body and 'Umar asked ('Abdullah), \"What news do you have?\"\n            He said, \"O chief of the believers! It is as you wish. She has given \n            the permission.\" 'Umar said, \"Praise be to Allah, there was nothing \n            more important to me than this. So when I die, take me, and greet \n            'Aisha and say: \"Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission (to be buried\n            with the Prophet ), and if she gives the permission, bury me there, \n            and if she refuses, then take me to the grave-yard of the Muslims.\" \n           Then Hafsa (the mother of the believers) came with many other women \n            walking with her. When we saw her, we went away. She went in (to \n            'Umar) and wept there for sometime. When the men asked for permission \n            to enter, she went into another place, and we heard her weeping \n            inside. The people said (to 'Umar), \"O chief of the believers!

His being a witness will compensate him for not sharing the \n            right of ruling. If Sad becomes the ruler, it will be alright: \n            otherwise, whoever becomes the ruler should seek his help, as I have \n            not dismissed him because of disability or dishonesty.\" 'Umar added, \n            \"I recommend that my successor takes care of the early emigrants; to \n            know their rights and protect their honor and sacred things. \n           I also recommend that he be kind to the Ansar who had lived in Medina \n            before the emigrants and Belief had entered their hearts before them. \n            I recommend that the (ruler) should accept the good of the righteous \n            among them and excuse their wrong-doers, and I recommend that he \n            should do good to all the people of the towns (Al-Ansar), as they are \n            the protectors of Islam and the source of wealth and the source of \n            annoyance to the enemy. I also recommend that nothing be taken from \n            them except from their surplus with their consent. I also recommend \n            that he do good to the 'Arab bedouin, as they are the origin of the \n            'Arabs and the material of Islam. He should take from what is \n            inferior, amongst their properties and distribute that to the poor \n            amongst them. I also recommend him concerning Allah's and His \n            Apostle's protectees (i.e. Dhimmis) to fulfill their contracts and to \n            fight for them and not to overburden them with what is beyond their \n            ability.\" So when 'Umar expired, we carried him out and set out \n            walking. 'Abdullah bin 'Umar greeted ('Aisha) and said, \"'Umar bin \n            Al-Khattab asks for the permission.\" 'Aisha said, \"Bring him in.\" He \n            was brought in and buried beside his two companions. \n           When he was buried, the group (recommended by 'Umar) held a meeting. \n            Then 'Abdur-Rahman said, \" Reduce the candidates for rulership to \n            three of you.\" Az-Zubair said, \"I give up my right to Ali.\" Talha \n            said, \"I give up my right to 'Uthman,\" Sad, 'I give up my right to \n            'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf.\" 'Abdur-Rahman then said (to 'Uthman and \n            'Ali), \"Now which of you is willing to give up his right of candidacy \n            to that he may choose the better of the (remaining) two, bearing in \n            mind that Allah and Islam will be his witnesses.\" So both the sheiks \n            (i.e. 'Uthman and 'Ali) kept silent. 'Abdur-Rahman said, \"Will you \n            both leave this matter to me, and I take Allah as my Witness that I \n            will not choose but the better of you?\" They said, \"Yes.\" So \n            'Abdur-Rahman took the hand of one of them (i.e. 'Ali) and said, \"You \n            are related to Allah's Apostle and one of the earliest Muslims as you \n            know well. So I ask you by Allah to promise that if I select you as a \n            ruler you will do justice, and if I select 'Uthman as a ruler you will\n            listen to him and obey him.\" Then he took the other (i.e. 'Uthman) \n            aside and said the same to him. When 'Abdur-Rahman secured (their \n            agreement to) this covenant, he said, \"O 'Uthman! Raise your hand.\" So\n            he (i.e. 'Abdur-Rahman) gave him (i.e. 'Uthman) the solemn pledge, and\n            then 'Ali gave him the pledge of allegiance and then all the (Medina) \n            people gave him the pledge of allegiance. \n        "},{"id":3210,"hadith":" Narrated Sahl bin Sad:\n           Allah's Apostle said, \"Tomorrow I will give the flag to a man with \n            whose leadership Allah will grant (the Muslim) victory.\" So the people\n            kept on thinking the whole night as to who would be given the flag. \n            The next morning the people went to Allah's Apostle and every one of \n            them hoped that he would be given the flag.

I \n            greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, 'You are \n            welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.' Then Gabriel ascended \n            with me to the sixth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It \n            was asked. 'Who is it?' Gabriel replied, 'Gabriel.' It was asked, 'Who\n            is accompanying you?' Gabriel replied, 'Muhammad.' It was asked, 'Has \n            he been called?' Gabriel replied in the affirmative. It was said, 'He \n            is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!' \n           When I went (over the sixth heaven), there I saw Moses. Gabriel said \n            (to me),' This is Moses; pay him your greeting. So I greeted him and \n            he returned the greetings to me and said, 'You are welcomed, O pious \n            brother and pious Prophet.' When I left him (i.e. Moses) he wept. \n            Someone asked him, 'What makes you weep?' Moses said, 'I weep because \n            after me there has been sent (as Prophet) a young man whose followers \n            will enter Paradise in greater numbers than my followers.' Then \n            Gabriel ascended with me to the seventh heaven and asked for its gate \n            to be opened. It was asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel replied, 'Gabriel.' \n            It was asked,' Who is accompanying you?' Gabriel replied, 'Muhammad.' \n            It was asked, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel replied in the \n            affirmative. Then it was said, 'He is welcomed. What an excellent \n            visit his is!'\n           So when I went (over the seventh heaven), there I saw Abraham. Gabriel\n            said (to me), 'This is your father; pay your greetings to him.' So I \n            greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, 'You are \n            welcomed, O pious son and pious Prophet.' Then I was made to ascend to\n            Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. the Lote Tree of the utmost boundary) Behold! \n            Its fruits were like the jars of Hajr (i.e. a place near Medina) and \n            its leaves were as big as the ears of elephants. Gabriel said, 'This \n            is the Lote Tree of the utmost boundary) . Behold ! There ran four \n            rivers, two were hidden and two were visible, I asked, 'What are these\n            two kinds of rivers, O Gabriel?' He replied,' As for the hidden \n            rivers, they are two rivers in Paradise and the visible rivers are the\n            Nile and the Euphrates.' \n           Then Al-Bait-ul-Ma'mur (i.e. the Sacred House) was shown to me and a \n            container full of wine and another full of milk and a third full of \n            honey were brought to me. I took the milk. Gabriel remarked, 'This is \n            the Islamic religion which you and your followers are following.' Then\n            the prayers were enjoined on me: They were fifty prayers a day. When I\n            returned, I passed by Moses who asked (me), 'What have you been \n            ordered to do?' I replied, 'I have been ordered to offer fifty prayers\n            a day.' Moses said, 'Your followers cannot bear fifty prayers a day, \n            and by Allah, I have tested people before you, and I have tried my \n            level best with Bani Israel (in vain). Go back to your Lord and ask \n            for reduction to lessen your followers' burden.' So I went back, and \n            Allah reduced ten prayers for me. Then again I came to Moses, but he \n            repeated the same as he had said before. Then again I went back to \n            Allah and He reduced ten more prayers. When I came back to Moses he \n            said the same, I went back to Allah and He ordered me to observe ten \n            prayers a day. When I came back to Moses, he repeated the same advice,\n            so I went back to Allah and was ordered to observe five prayers a day.\n           When I came back to Moses, he said, 'What have you been ordered?' I \n            replied, 'I have been ordered to observe five prayers a day.' He said,\n            'Your followers cannot bear five prayers a day, and no doubt, I have \n            got an experience of the people before you, and I have tried my level \n            best with Bani Israel, so go back to your Lord and ask for reduction \n            to lessen your follower's burden.' I said, 'I have requested so much \n            of my Lord that I feel ashamed, but I am satisfied now and surrender \n            to Allah's Order.' When I left, I heard a voice saying, 'I have passed\n            My Order and have lessened the burden of My Worshipers.\" \n        "},{"id":3388,"hadith":" Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:\n           Regarding the Statement of Allah\"\n           \"And We granted the vision (Ascension to the heavens) which We made \n            you see (as an actual eye witness) was only made as a trial for the \n            people.\"    (17.60)\n           Ibn Abbas added: The sights which Allah's Apostle was shown on the \n            Night Journey when he was taken to Bait-ulMaqdis (i.e. Jerusalem) were\n            actual sights, (not dreams).

He can pray and recite \n            there whatever he likes, but he should not hurt us with it, and should\n            not do it publicly, because we are afraid that he may affect our women\n            and children.\" Ibn Ad-Daghina told Abu Bakr of all that. Abu Bakr \n            stayed in that state, worshipping his Lord in his house. He did not \n            pray publicly, nor did he recite Quran outside his house. \n           Then a thought occurred to Abu Bakr to build a mosque in front of his \n            house, and there he used to pray and recite the Quran. The women and \n            children of the pagans began to gather around him in great number. \n            They used to wonder at him and look at him. Abu Bakr was a man who \n            used to weep too much, and he could not help weeping on reciting the \n            Quran. That situation scared the nobles of the pagans of Quraish, so \n            they sent for Ibn Ad-Daghina. When he came to them, they said, \"We \n            accepted your protection of Abu Bakr on condition that he should \n            worship his Lord in his house, but he has violated the conditions and \n            he has built a mosque in front of his house where he prays and recites\n            the Quran publicly. We are now afraid that he may affect our women and\n            children unfavorably. So, prevent him from that. If he likes to \n            confine the worship of his Lord to his house, he may do so, but if he \n            insists on doing that openly, ask him to release you from your \n            obligation to protect him, for we dislike to break our pact with you, \n            but we deny Abu Bakr the right to announce his act publicly.\" Ibn \n            Ad-Daghina went to Abu- Bakr and said, (\"O Abu Bakr!) You know well \n            what contract I have made on your behalf; now, you are either to abide\n            by it, or else release me from my obligation of protecting you, \n            because I do not want the 'Arabs hear that my people have dishonored a\n            contract I have made on behalf of another man.\" Abu Bakr replied, \"I \n            release you from your pact to protect me, and am pleased with the \n            protection from Allah.\" \n           At that time the Prophet was in Mecca, and he said to the Muslims, \"In\n            a dream I have been shown your migration place, a land of date palm \n            trees, between two mountains, the two stony tracts.\" So, some people \n            migrated to Medina, and most of those people who had previously \n            migrated to the land of Ethiopia, returned to Medina. Abu Bakr also \n            prepared to leave for Medina, but Allah's Apostle said to him, \"Wait \n            for a while, because I hope that I will be allowed to migrate also.\" \n            Abu Bakr said, \"Do you indeed expect this? Let my father be sacrificed\n            for you!\" The Prophet said, \"Yes.\" So Abu Bakr did not migrate for the\n            sake of Allah's Apostle in order to accompany him. He fed two \n            she-camels he possessed with the leaves of As-Samur tree that fell on \n            being struck by a stick for four months. \n           One day, while we were sitting in Abu Bakr's house at noon, someone \n            said to Abu Bakr, \"This is Allah's Apostle with his head covered \n            coming at a time at which he never used to visit us before.\" Abu Bakr \n            said, \"May my parents be sacrificed for him. By Allah, he has not come\n            at this hour except for a great necessity.\" So Allah's Apostle came \n            and asked permission to enter, and he was allowed to enter. When he \n            entered, he said to Abu Bakr. \"Tell everyone who is present with you \n            to go away.\" Abu Bakr replied, \"There are none but your family. May my\n            father be sacrificed for you, O Allah's Apostle!\" The Prophet said, \"i\n            have been given permission to migrate.\" Abu Bakr said, \"Shall I \n            accompany you? May my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah's \n            Apostle!\" Allah's Apostle said, \"Yes.\" Abu Bakr said, \"O Allah's \n            Apostle! May my father be sacrificed for you, take one of these two \n            she-camels of mine.\" Allah's Apostle replied, \"(I will accept it) with\n            payment.\" So we prepared the baggage quickly and put some journey food\n            in a leather bag for them. Asma, Abu Bakr's daughter, cut a piece from\n            her waist belt and tied the mouth of the leather bag with it, and for \n            that reason she was named Dhat-un-Nitaqain (i.e. the owner of two \n            belts). \n           Then Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr reached a cave on the mountain of \n            Thaur and stayed there for three nights. 'Abdullah bin Abi Bakr who \n            was intelligent and a sagacious youth, used to stay (with them) aver \n            night. He used to leave them before day break so that in the morning \n            he would be with Quraish as if he had spent the night in Mecca. He \n            would keep in mind any plot made against them, and when it became dark\n            he would (go and) inform them of it. 'Amir bin Fuhaira, the freed \n            slave of Abu Bakr, used to bring the milch sheep (of his master, Abu \n            Bakr) to them a little while after nightfall in order to rest the \n            sheep there. So they always had fresh milk at night, the milk of their\n            sheep, and the milk which they warmed by throwing heated stones in it.\n            'Amir bin Fuhaira would then call the herd away when it was still dark\n            (before daybreak). He did the same in each of those three nights. \n            Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr had hired a man from the tribe of Bani \n            Ad-Dail from the family of Bani Abd bin Adi as an expert guide, and he\n            was in alliance with the family of Al-'As bin Wail As-Sahmi and he was\n            on the religion of the infidels of Quraish. The Prophet and Abu Bakr \n            trusted him and gave him their two she-camels and took his promise to \n            bring their two she camels to the cave of the mountain of Thaur in the\n            morning after three nights later. And (when they set out), 'Amir bin \n            Fuhaira and the guide went along with them and the guide led them \n            along the sea-shore.\n           The nephew of Suraqa bin Ju'sham said that his father informed him \n            that he heard Suraqa bin Ju'sham saying, \"The messengers of the \n            heathens of Quraish came to us declaring that they had assigned for \n            the persons why would kill or arrest Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr, a \n            reward equal to their bloodmoney. While I was sitting in one of the \n            gatherings of my tribe. Bani Mudlij, a man from them came to us and \n            stood up while we were sitting, and said, \"O Suraqa! No doubt, I have \n            just seen some people far away on the seashore, and I think they are \n            Muhammad and his companions.\" Suraqa added, \"I too realized that it \n            must have been they. But I said 'No, it is not they, but you have seen\n            so-and-so, and so-and-so whom we saw set out.' I stayed in the \n            gathering for a while and then got up and left for my home. and \n            ordered my slave-girl to get my horse which was behind a hillock, and \n            keep it ready for me. \n           Then I took my spear and left by the back door of my house dragging \n            the lower end of the spear on the ground and keeping it low. Then I \n            reached my horse, mounted it and made it gallop. When I approached \n            them (i.e. Muhammad and Abu Bakr), my horse stumbled and I fell down \n            from it, Then I stood up, got hold of my quiver and took out the \n            divining arrows and drew lots as to whether I should harm them (i.e. \n            the Prophet and Abu Bakr) or not, and the lot which I disliked came \n            out. But I remounted my horse and let it gallop, giving no importance \n            to the divining arrows. When I heard the recitation of the Quran by \n            Allah's Apostle who did not look hither and thither while Abu Bakr was\n            doing it often, suddenly the forelegs of my horse sank into the ground\n            up to the knees, and I fell down from it. Then I rebuked it and it got\n            up but could hardly take out its forelegs from the ground, and when it\n            stood up straight again, its fore-legs caused dust to rise up in the \n            sky like smoke. Then again I drew lots with the divining arrows, and \n            the lot which I disliked, came out. So I called upon them to feel \n            secure. They stopped, and I remounted my horse and went to them. When \n            I saw how I had been hampered from harming them, it came to my mind \n            that the cause of Allah's Apostle (i.e. Islam) will become victorious.\n            So I said to him, \"Your people have assigned a reward equal to the \n            bloodmoney for your head.\" Then I told them all the plans the people \n            of Mecca had made concerning them. Then I offered them some journey \n            food and goods but they refused to take anything and did not ask for \n            anything, but the Prophet said, \"Do not tell others about us.\" Then I \n            requested him to write for me a statement of security and peace. He \n            ordered 'Amr bin Fuhaira who wrote it for me on a parchment, and then \n            Allah's Apostle proceeded on his way.\n           Narrated 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair: Allah's Apostle met Az-Zubair in a \n            caravan of Muslim merchants who were returning from Sham. Az-Zubair \n            provided Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr with white clothes to wear. When\n            the Muslims of Medina heard the news of the departure of Allah's \n            Apostle from Mecca (towards Medina), they started going to the Harra \n            every morning . They would wait for him till the heat of the noon \n            forced them to return. One day, after waiting for a long while, they \n            returned home, and when they went into their houses, a Jew climbed up \n            the roof of one of the forts of his people to look for some thing, and\n            he saw Allah's Apostle and his companions dressed in white clothes, \n            emerging out of the desert mirage. \n           The Jew could not help shouting at the top of his voice, \"O you \n            'Arabs! Here is your great man whom you have been waiting for!\" So all\n            the Muslims rushed to their arms and received Allah's Apostle on the \n            summit of Harra. The Prophet turned with them to the right and \n            alighted at the quarters of Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf, and this was on Monday\n            in the month of Rabi-ul-Awal. Abu Bakr stood up, receiving the people \n            while Allah's Apostle sat down and kept silent. Some of the Ansar who \n            came and had not seen Allah's Apostle before, began greeting Abu Bakr,\n            but when the sunshine fell on Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr came \n            forward and shaded him with his sheet only then the people came to \n            know Allah's Apostle. Allah's Apostle stayed with Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf \n            for ten nights and established the mosque (mosque of Quba) which was \n            founded on piety. Allah's Apostle prayed in it and then mounted his \n            she-camel and proceeded on, accompanied by the people till his \n            she-camel knelt down at (the place of) the Mosque of Allah's Apostle \n            at Medina. Some Muslims used to pray there in those days, and that \n            place was a yard for drying dates belonging to Suhail and Sahl, the \n            orphan boys who were under the guardianship of 'Asad bin Zurara. When \n            his she-camel knelt down, Allah's Apostle said, \"This place, Allah \n            willing, will be our abiding place.\" Allah's Apostle then called the \n            two boys and told them to suggest a price for that yard so that he \n            might take it as a mosque. The two boys said, \"No, but we will give it\n            as a gift, O Allah's Apostle!\" Allah's Apostle then built a mosque \n            there. The Prophet himself started carrying unburnt bricks for its \n            building and while doing so, he was saying \"This load is better than \n            the load of Khaibar, for it is more pious in the Sight of Allah and \n            purer and better rewardable.\" He was also saying, \"O Allah! The actual\n            reward is the reward in the Hereafter, so bestow Your Mercy on the \n            Ansar and the Emigrants.\" Thus the Prophet recited (by way of proverb)\n            the poem of some Muslim poet whose name is unknown to me.\n           (Ibn Shibab said, \"In the Hadiths it does not occur that Allah's \n            Apostle\n           recited a complete poetic verse other than this one.\") \n        "},{"id":3406,"hadith":" Narrated Asma:\n           I prepared the journey food for the Prophet and Abu Bakr when they \n            wanted (to migrate to) Medina.

So I reached him and found him sleeping in a \n          dark house amidst his family, I could not recognize his location in \n          the house. So I shouted, 'O Abu Rafi!' Abu Rafi said, 'Who is it?' I \n          proceeded towards the source of the voice and hit him with the sword, \n          and because of my perplexity, I could not kill him. He cried loudly, \n          and I came out of the house and waited for a while, and then went to \n          him again and said, 'What is this voice, O Abu Rafi?' He said, 'Woe to\n          your mother! A man in my house has hit me with a sword! I again hit \n          him severely but I did not kill him.

I then opened the doors \n          one by one till I reached the staircase, and thinking that I had \n          reached the ground, I stepped out and fell down and got my leg broken \n          in a moonlit night.

The third man who was with \n          them said, \"This is the first breach in the covenant,\" and refused to \n          accompany them. They dragged him and tried to make him accompany them,\n          but he refused, and they killed him. Then they proceeded on taking \n          Khubaib and Zaid till they sold them in Mecca. The sons of Al-Harith \n          bin 'Amr bin Naufal bought Khubaib. It was Khubaib who had killed \n          Al-Harith bin 'Amr on the day of Badr. Khubaib stayed with them for a \n          while as a captive till they decided unanimously to kill him. (At that\n          time) Khubaib borrowed a razor from one of the daughters of Al-Harith \n          to shave his pubic hair. She gave it to him. She said later on, \"I was\n          heedless of a little baby of mine, who moved towards Khubaib, and when\n          it reached him, he put it on his thigh. \n         When I saw it, I got scared so much that Khubaib noticed my distress \n          while he was carrying the razor in his hand. He said 'Are you afraid \n          that I will kill it? Allah willing, I will never do that,' \" Later on \n          she used to say, \"I have never seen a captive better than Khubaib Once\n          I saw him eating from a bunch of grapes although at that time no \n          fruits were available at Mecca, and he was fettered with iron chains, \n          and in fact, it was nothing but food bestowed upon him by Allah.\" So \n          they took him out of the Sanctuary (of Mecca) to kill him. He said, \n          \"Allow me to offer a two-Rak'at prayer.\" Then he went to them and \n          said, \"Had I not been afraid that you would think I was afraid of \n          death, I would have prayed for a longer time.\" So it was Khubaib who \n          first set the tradition of praying two Rakat before being executed. He\n          then said, \"O Allah! Count them one by one,\" and added, 'When I am \n          being martyred as a Muslim, I do not care in what way I receive my \n          death for Allah's Sake, because this death is in Allah's Cause. If He \n          wishes, He will bless the cut limbs.\" Then 'Uqba bin Al-Harith got up \n          and martyred him. The narrator added: The Quraish (infidels) sent some\n          people to 'Asim in order to bring a part of his body so that his death\n          might be known for certain, for 'Asim had killed one of their chiefs \n          on the day of Badr.

The people dispersed amongst the\n          trees in order to have shade. While we were in this state, Allah's \n          Apostle called us and we came and found a bedouin sitting in front of \n          him.

He drew lots amongst us during one of the \n          Ghazwat which he fought. The lot fell on me and so I proceeded with \n          Allah's Apostle after Allah's order of veiling (the women) had been \n          revealed. I was carried (on the back of a camel) in my howdah and \n          carried down while still in it (when we came to a halt). So we went on\n          till Allah's Apostle had finished from that Ghazwa of his and \n          returned. \n         When we approached the city of Medina he announced at night that it \n          was time for departure. So when they announced the news of departure, \n          I got up and went away from the army camps, and after finishing from \n          the call of nature, I came back to my riding animal. I touched my \n          chest to find that my necklace which was made of Zifar beads (i.e. \n          Yemenite beads partly black and partly white) was missing. So I \n          returned to look for my necklace and my search for it detained me. (In\n          the meanwhile) the people who used to carry me on my camel, came and \n          took my howdah and put it on the back of my camel on which I used to \n          ride, as they considered that I was in it. In those days women were \n          light in weight for they did not get fat, and flesh did not cover \n          their bodies in abundance as they used to eat only a little food. \n          Those people therefore, disregarded the lightness of the howdah while \n          lifting and carrying it; and at that time I was still a young girl. \n          They made the camel rise and all of them left (along with it). I found\n          my necklace after the army had gone. \n         Then I came to their camping place to find no call maker of them, nor \n          one who would respond to the call. So I intended to go to the place \n          where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back \n          to me (in my search). While I was sitting in my resting place, I was \n          overwhelmed by sleep and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattal As-Sulami \n          Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army. When he reached my place in the \n          morning, he saw the figure of a sleeping person and he recognized me \n          on seeing me as he had seen me before the order of compulsory veiling \n          (was prescribed). So I woke up when he recited Istirja' (i.e. \"Inna \n          lillahi wa inna llaihi raji'un\") as soon as he recognized me. I veiled\n          my face with my head cover at once, and by Allah, we did not speak a \n          single word, and I did not hear him saying any word besides his \n          Istirja'. He dismounted from his camel and made it kneel down, putting\n          his leg on its front legs and then I got up and rode on it. Then he \n          set out leading the camel that was carrying me till we overtook the \n          army in the extreme heat of midday while they were at a halt (taking a\n          rest). (Because of the event) some people brought destruction upon \n          themselves and the one who spread the Ifk (i.e. slander) more, was \n          'Abdullah bin Ubai Ibn Salul.\"\n         (Urwa said, \"The people propagated the slander and talked about it in \n          his (i.e. 'Abdullah's) presence and he confirmed it and listened to it\n          and asked about it to let it prevail.\" Urwa also added, \"None was \n          mentioned as members of the slanderous group besides ('Abdullah) \n          except Hassan bin Thabit and Mistah bin Uthatha and Hamna bint Jahsh \n          along with others about whom I have no knowledge, but they were a \n          group as Allah said. It is said that the one who carried most of the \n          slander was 'Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul.\" Urwa added, \"'Aisha \n          disliked to have Hassan abused in her presence and she used to say, \n          'It was he who said: My father and his (i.e. my father's) father and \n          my honor are all for the protection of Muhammad's honor from you.\").\n         'Aisha added, \"After we returned to Medina, I became ill for a month. \n          The people were propagating the forged statements of the slanderers \n          while I was unaware of anything of all that, but I felt that in my \n          present ailment, I was not receiving the same kindness from Allah's \n          Apostle as I used to receive when I got sick. (But now) Allah's \n          Apostle would only come, greet me and say,' How is that (lady)?' and \n          leave. That roused my doubts, but I did not discover the evil (i.e. \n          slander) till I went out after my convalescence, I went out with Um \n          Mistah to Al-Manasi' where we used to answer the call of nature and we\n          used not to go out (to answer the call of nature) except at night, and\n          that was before we had latrines near our houses. And this habit of our\n          concerning evacuating the bowels, was similar to the habits of the old\n          'Arabs living in the deserts, for it would be troublesome for us to \n          take latrines near our houses. So I and Um Mistah who was the daughter\n          of Abu Ruhm bin Al-Muttalib bin Abd Manaf, whose mother was the \n          daughter of Sakhr bin 'Amir and the aunt of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and \n          whose son was Mistah bin Uthatha bin 'Abbas bin Al-Muttalib, went out.\n          I and Um Mistah returned to my house after we finished answering the \n          call of nature. Um Mistah stumbled by getting her foot entangled in \n          her covering sheet and on that she said, 'Let Mistah be ruined!' I \n          said, 'What a hard word you have said. Do you abuse a man who took \n          part in the battle of Badr?' On that she said, 'O you Hantah! Didn't \n          you hear what he (i.e. Mistah) said? 'I said, 'What did he say?'\n         Then she told me the slander of the people of Ifk. So my ailment was \n          aggravated, and when I reached my home, Allah's Apostle came to me, \n          and after greeting me, said, 'How is that (lady)?' I said, 'Will you \n          allow me to go to my parents?' as I wanted to be sure about the news \n          through them. Allah's Apostle allowed me (and I went to my parents) \n          and asked my mother, 'O mother! What are the people talking about?' \n          She said, 'O my daughter! Don't worry, for scarcely is there a \n          charming woman who is loved by her husband and whose husband has other\n          wives besides herself that they (i.e. women) would find faults with \n          her.' I said, 'Subhan-Allah! (I testify the uniqueness of Allah). Are \n          the people really talking in this way?' I kept on weeping that night \n          till dawn I could neither stop weeping nor sleep then in the morning \n          again, I kept on weeping. When the Divine Inspiration was delayed. \n         Allah's Apostle called 'Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid to ask \n          and consult them about divorcing me. Usama bin Zaid said what he knew \n          of my innocence, and the respect he preserved in himself for me. Usama\n          said, '(O Allah's Apostle!) She is your wife and we do not know \n          anything except good about her.' 'Ali bin Abi Talib said, 'O Allah's \n          Apostle! Allah does not put you in difficulty and there are plenty of \n          women other than she, yet, ask the maid-servant who will tell you the \n          truth.' On that Allah's Apostle called Barira (i.e. the maid-servant) \n          and said, 'O Barira! Did you ever see anything which aroused your \n          suspicion?' Barira said to him, 'By Him Who has sent you with the \n          Truth. I have never seen anything in her (i.e. Aisha) which I would \n          conceal, except that she is a young girl who sleeps leaving the dough \n          of her family exposed so that the domestic goats come and eat it.' \n         So, on that day, Allah's Apostle got up on the pulpit and complained \n          about 'Abdullah bin Ubai (bin Salul) before his companions, saying, 'O\n          you Muslims! Who will relieve me from that man who has hurt me with \n          his evil statement about my family? By Allah, I know nothing except \n          good about my family and they have blamed a man about whom I know \n          nothing except good and he used never to enter my home except with \n          me.' Sad bin Mu'adh the brother of Banu 'Abd Al-Ashhal got up and \n          said, 'O Allah's Apostle! I will relieve you from him; if he is from \n          the tribe of Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off, and if he is from \n          our brothers, i.e. Al-Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your\n          order.' On that, a man from Al-Khazraj got up. Um Hassan, his cousin, \n          was from his branch tribe, and he was Sad bin Ubada, chief of \n          Al-Khazraj. Before this incident, he was a pious man, but his love for\n          his tribe goaded him into saying to Sad (bin Mu'adh). 'By Allah, you \n          have told a lie; you shall not and cannot kill him. If he belonged to \n          your people, you would not wish him to be killed.' \n         On that, Usaid bin Hudair who was the cousin of Sad (bin Mu'adh) got \n          up and said to Sad bin 'Ubada, 'By Allah! You are a liar! We will \n          surely kill him, and you are a hypocrite arguing on the behalf of \n          hypocrites.' On this, the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al Khazraj got so \n          much excited that they were about to fight while Allah's Apostle was \n          standing on the pulpit. Allah's Apostle kept on quietening them till \n          they became silent and so did he. All that day I kept on weeping with \n          my tears never ceasing, and I could never sleep.\n         In the morning my parents were with me and I wept for two nights and a\n          day with my tears never ceasing and I could never sleep till I thought\n          that my liver would burst from weeping. So, while my parents were \n          sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked me to grant \n          her admittance. I allowed her to come in, and when she came in, she \n          sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, \n          Allah's Apostle came, greeted us and sat down. He had never sat with \n          me since that day of the slander. A month had elapsed and no Divine \n          Inspiration came to him about my case. Allah's Apostle then recited \n          Tashah-hud and then said, 'Amma Badu, O 'Aisha! I have been informed \n          so-and-so about you; if you are innocent, then soon Allah will reveal \n          your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah \n          and ask Him for forgiveness for when a slave confesses his sins and \n          asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance.'\n         When Allah's Apostle finished his speech, my tears ceased flowing \n          completely that I no longer felt a single drop of tear flowing. I said\n          to my father, 'Reply to Allah's Apostle on my behalf concerning what \n          he has said.' My father said, 'By Allah, I do not know what to say to \n          Allah's Apostle .' Then I said to my mother, 'Reply to Allah's Apostle\n          on my behalf concerning what he has said.' She said, 'By Allah, I do \n          not know what to say to Allah's Apostle.' In spite of the fact that I \n          was a young girl and had a little knowledge of Quran, I said, 'By \n          Allah, no doubt I know that you heard this (slanderous) speech so that\n          it has been planted in your hearts (i.e. minds) and you have taken it \n          as a truth. Now if I tell you that I am innocent, you will not believe\n          me, and if confess to you about it, and Allah knows that I am \n          innocent, you will surely believe me. By Allah, I find no similitude \n          for me and you except that of Joseph's father when he said, '(For me) \n          patience in the most fitting against that which you assert; it is \n          Allah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.' Then I turned to the other \n          side and lay on my bed; and Allah knew then that I was innocent and \n          hoped that Allah would reveal my innocence. But, by Allah, I never \n          thought that Allah would reveal about my case, Divine Inspiration, \n          that would be recited (forever) as I considered myself too unworthy to\n          be talked of by Allah with something of my concern, but I hoped that \n          Allah's Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my \n          innocence. But, by Allah, before Allah's Apostle left his seat and \n          before any of the household left, the Divine inspiration came to \n          Allah's Apostle.\n         So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake \n          him, (when he used to be inspired Divinely). The sweat was dropping \n          from his body like pearls though it was a wintry day and that was \n          because of the weighty statement which was being revealed to him. When\n          that state of Allah's Apostle was over, he got up smiling, and the \n          first word he said was, 'O 'Aisha! Allah has declared your innocence!'\n          Then my Mother said to me, 'Get up and go to him (i.e. Allah's \n          Apostle). I replied, 'By Allah, I will not go to him, and I praise \n          none but Allah. So Allah revealed the ten Verses:-- \"Verily! They who \n          spread the slander Are a gang, among you.............\" (24.11-20) \n         Allah revealed those Quranic Verses to declare my innocence. Abu Bakr \n          As-Siddiq who used to disburse money for Mistah bin Uthatha because of\n          his relationship to him and his poverty, said, 'By Allah, I will never\n          give to Mistah bin Uthatha anything after what he has said about \n          Aisha.' Then Allah revealed:--\n         \"And let not those among you who are good and wealthy swear not to \n          give (any sort of help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who\n          have left their homes for Allah's cause, let them pardon and forgive. \n          Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah is \n          oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.\" (24.22) \n         Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said, 'Yes, by Allah, I would like that Allah \n          forgive me.' and went on giving Mistah the money he used to give him \n          before. He also added, 'By Allah, I will never deprive him of it at \n          all.'\n         Aisha further said:.\" Allah's Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh \n          (i.e. his wife) about my case. He said to Zainab, 'What do you know \n          and what did you see?\" She replied, \"O Allah's Apostle! I refrain from\n          claiming falsely that I have heard or seen anything. By Allah, I know \n          nothing except good (about 'Aisha).' From amongst the wives of the \n          Prophet Zainab was my peer (in beauty and in the love she received \n          from the Prophet) but Allah saved her from that evil because of her \n          piety. Her sister Hamna, started struggling on her behalf and she was \n          destroyed along with those who were destroyed. The man who was blamed \n          said, 'Subhan-Allah! By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I have never \n          uncovered the cover (i.e. veil) of any female.'

Kab said, \"I did not remain behind \n          Allah's Apostle in any Ghazwa that he fought except the Ghazwa of \n          Tabuk, and I failed to take part in the Ghazwa of Badr, but Allah did \n          not admonish anyone who had not participated in it, for in fact, \n          Allah's Apostle had gone out in search of the caravan of Quraish till \n          Allah made them (i.e. the Muslims) and their enemy meet without any \n          appointment. I witnessed the night of Al-'Aqaba (pledge) with Allah's \n          Apostle when we pledged for Islam, and I would not exchange it for the\n          Badr battle although the Badr battle is more popular amongst the \n          people than it (i.e. Al-'Aqaba pledge). As for my news (in this battle\n          of Tabuk), I had never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I \n          remained behind the Prophet in that Ghazwa. \n         By Allah, never had I two she-camels before, but I had then at the \n          time of this Ghazwa. Whenever Allah's Apostle wanted to make a Ghazwa,\n          he used to hide his intention by apparently referring to different \n          Ghazwa till it was the time of that Ghazwa (of Tabuk) which Allah's \n          Apostle fought in severe heat, facing, a long journey, desert, and the\n          great number of enemy. So the Prophet announced to the Muslims clearly\n          (their destination) so that they might get prepared for their Ghazwa. \n          So he informed them clearly of the destination he was going to. \n          Allah's Apostle was accompanied by a large number of Muslims who could\n          not be listed in a book namely, a register.\" Ka'b added, \"Any man who \n          intended to be absent would think that the matter would remain hidden \n          unless Allah revealed it through Divine Revelation. So Allah's Apostle\n          fought that Ghazwa at the time when the fruits had ripened and the \n          shade looked pleasant. Allah's Apostle and his companions prepared for\n          the battle and I started to go out in order to get myself ready along \n          with them, but I returned without doing anything. I would say to \n          myself, 'I can do that.' So I kept on delaying it every now and then \n          till the people got ready and Allah's Apostle and the Muslims along \n          with him departed, and I had not prepared anything for my departure, \n          and I said, I will prepare myself (for departure) one or two days \n          after him, and then join them.' In the morning following their \n          departure, I went out to get myself ready but returned having done \n          nothing. Then again in the next morning, I went out to get ready but \n          returned without doing anything. \n         Such was the case with me till they hurried away and the battle was \n          missed (by me). Even then I intended to depart to take them over. I \n          wish I had done so! But it was not in my luck. So, after the departure\n          of Allah's Apostle, whenever I went out and walked amongst the people \n          (i.e, the remaining persons), it grieved me that I could see none \n          around me, but one accused of hypocrisy or one of those weak men whom \n          Allah had excused. Allah's Apostle did not remember me till he reached\n          Tabuk. So while he was sitting amongst the people in Tabuk, he said, \n          'What did Ka'b do?' A man from Banu Salama said, 'O Allah's Apostle! \n          He has been stopped by his two Burdas (i.e. garments) and his looking \n          at his own flanks with pride.' Then Mu'adh bin Jabal said, 'What a bad\n          thing you have said! By Allah! O Allahs Apostle! We know nothing about\n          him but good.' Allah's Apostle kept silent.\" Ka'b bin Malik added, \n          \"When I heard that he (i.e. the Prophet ) was on his way back to \n          Medina. I got dipped in my concern, and began to think of false \n          excuses, saying to myself, 'How can I avoid his anger tomorrow?' And I\n          took the advice of wise member of my family in this matter. When it \n          was said that Allah's Apostle, had come near all the evil false \n          excuses abandoned from my mind and I knew well that I could never come\n          out of this problem by forging a false statement. Then I decided \n          firmly to speak the truth. So Allah's Apostle arrived in the morning, \n          and whenever he returned from a journey., he used to visit the Mosque \n          first of all and offer a two-Rak'at prayer therein and then sit for \n          the people. So when he had done all that (this time), those who had \n          failed to join the battle (of Tabuk) came and started offering (false)\n          excuses and taking oaths before him. They were something over eighty \n          men; Allah's Apostle accepted the excuses they had expressed, took \n          their pledge of allegiance asked for Allah's Forgiveness for them, and\n          left the secrets of their hearts for Allah to judge. Then I came to \n          him, and when I greeted him, he smiled a smile of an angry person and \n          then said, 'Come on.' So I came walking till I sat before him. He said\n          to me, 'What stopped you from joining us. Had you not purchased an \n          animal For carrying you?' I answered, \"Yes, O Allah's Apostle! But by \n          Allah, if I were sitting before any person from among the people of \n          the world other than you, I would have avoided his anger with an \n          excuse. \n         By Allah, I have been bestowed with the power of speaking fluently and\n          eloquently, but by Allah, I knew well that if today I tell you a lie \n          to seek your favor, Allah would surely make you angry with me in the \n          near future, but if I tell you the truth, though you will get angry \n          because of it, I hope for Allah's Forgiveness. Really, by Allah, there\n          was no excuse for me. By Allah, I had never been stronger or wealthier\n          than I was when I remained behind you.' Then Allah's Apostle said, 'As\n          regards this man, he has surely told the truth. So get up till Allah \n          decides your case.' I got up, and many men of Banu Salama followed me \n          and said to me. 'By Allah, we never witnessed you doing any sin before\n          this. Surely, you failed to offer excuse to Allah's Apostle as the \n          others who did not join him, have offered. The prayer of Allah's \n          Apostle to Allah to forgive you would have been sufficient for you.' \n          By Allah, they continued blaming me so much that I intended to return \n          (to the Prophet) and accuse myself of having told a lie, but I said to\n          them, 'Is there anybody else who has met the same fate as I have?' \n          They replied, 'Yes, there are two men who have said the same thing as \n          you have, and to both of them was given the same order as given to \n          you.' I said, 'Who are they?' They replied, Murara bin Ar-Rabi Al-Amri\n          and Hilal bin Umaiya Al-Waqifi.' By that they mentioned to me two \n          pious men who had attended the Ghazwa (Battle) of Badr, and in whom \n          there was an example for me. So I did not change my mind when they \n          mentioned them to me. Allah's Apostle forbade all the Muslims to talk \n          to us, the three aforesaid persons out of all those who had remained \n          behind in that Ghazwa. So we kept away from the people and they \n          changed their attitude towards us till the very land (where I lived) \n          appeared strange to me as if I did not know it.\n         We remained in that condition for fifty nights. As regards my two \n          fellows, they remained in their houses and kept on weeping, but I was \n          the youngest of them and the firmest of them, so I used to go out and \n          witness the prayers along with the Muslims and roam about in the \n          markets, but none would talk to me, and I would come to Allah's \n          Apostle and greet him while he was sitting In his gathering after the \n          prayer, and I would wonder whether the Prophet did move his lips in \n          return to my greetings or not. Then I would offer my prayer near to \n          him and look at him stealthily. When I was busy with my prayer, he \n          would turn his face towards me, but when I turned my face to him, he \n          would turn his face away from me. When this harsh attitude of the \n          people lasted long, I walked till I scaled the wall of the garden of \n          Abu Qatada who was my cousin and dearest person to me, and I offered \n          my greetings to him. By Allah, he did not return my greetings. I said,\n          'O Abu Qatada! I beseech you by Allah! Do you know that I love Allah \n          and His Apostle?' He kept quiet. I asked him again, beseeching him by \n          Allah, but he remained silent. Then I asked him again in the Name of \n          Allah. He said, \"Allah and His Apostle know it better.' Thereupon my \n          eyes flowed with tears and I returned and jumped over the wall.\" Ka'b \n          added, \"While I was walking in the market of Medina, suddenly I saw a \n          Nabati (i.e. a Christian farmer) from the Nabatis of Sham who came to \n          sell his grains in Medina, saying, 'Who will lead me to Kab bin \n          Malik?' The people began to point (me) out for him till he came to me \n          and handed me a letter from the king of Ghassan in which the following\n          was written:\n         \"To proceed, I have been informed that your friend (i.e. the Prophet )\n          has treated you harshly. Anyhow, Allah does not let you live at a \n          place where you feel inferior and your right is lost. So join us, and \n          we will console you.\"\n         When I read it, I said to myself, 'This is also a sort of a test.' \n          Then I took the letter to the oven and made a fire therein by burning \n          it. When forty out of the fifty nights elapsed, behold ! There came to\n          me the messenger of Allah's Apostle and said, 'Allah's Apostle orders \n          you to keep away from your wife,' I said, 'Should I divorce her; or \n          else! what should I do?' He said, 'No, only keep aloof from her and do\n          not cohabit her.' The Prophet sent the same message to my two fellows.\n          Then I said to my wife. 'Go to your parents and remain with them till \n          Allah gives His Verdict in this matter.\" Kab added, \"The wife of Hilal\n          bin Umaiya came to Apostle and said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Hilal bin \n          Umaiya is a helpless old man who has no servant to attend on him. Do \n          you dislike that I should serve him? ' He said, 'No (you can serve \n          him) but he should not come near you.' She said, 'By Allah, he has no \n          desire for anything. By, Allah, he has never ceased weeping till his \n          case began till this day of his.' \n         On that, some of my family members said to me, 'Will you also ask \n          Allah's Apostle to permit your wife (to serve you) as he has permitted\n          the wife of Hilal bin Umaiya to serve him?' I said, 'By Allah, I will \n          not ask the permission of Allah's Apostle regarding her, for I do not \n          know What Allah's Apostle would say if I asked him to permit her (to \n          serve me) while I am a young man.' Then I remained in that state for \n          ten more nights after that till the period of fifty nights was \n          completed starting from the time when Allah's Apostle prohibited the \n          people from talking to us. When I had offered the Fajr prayer on the \n          50th morning on the roof of one of our houses and while I was sitting \n          in the condition which Allah described (in the Quran) i.e. my very \n          soul seemed straitened to me and even the earth seemed narrow to me \n          for all its spaciousness, there I heard the voice of one who had \n          ascended the mountain of Sala' calling with his loudest voice, 'O Kab \n          bin Malik! Be happy (by receiving good tidings).' I fell down in \n          prostration before Allah, realizing that relief has come. Allah's \n          Apostle had announced the acceptance of our repentance by Allah when \n          he had offered the Fajr prayer. The people then went out to \n          congratulate us. Some bringers of good tidings went out to my two \n          fellows, and a horseman came to me in haste, and a man of Banu Aslam \n          came running and ascended the mountain and his voice was swifter than \n          the horse. When he (i.e. the man) whose voice I had heard, came to me \n          conveying the good tidings, I took off my garments and dressed him \n          with them; and by Allah, I owned no other garments than them on that \n          day. Then I borrowed two garments and wore them and went to Allah's \n          Apostle.\n         The people started receiving me in batches, congratulating me on \n          Allah's Acceptance of my repentance, saying, 'We congratulate you on \n          Allah's Acceptance of your repentance.\" Kab further said, \"When I \n          entered the Mosque. I saw Allah's Apostle sitting with the people \n          around him. Talha bin Ubaidullah swiftly came to me, shook hands with \n          me and congratulated me. By Allah, none of the Muhajirin (i.e. \n          Emigrants) got up for me except him (i.e. Talha), and I will never \n          forget this for Talha.\" Kab added, \"When I greeted Allah's Apostle he,\n          his face being bright with joy, said \"Be happy with the best day that \n          you have got ever since your mother delivered you.\" Kab added, \"I said\n          to the Prophet 'Is this forgiveness from you or from Allah?' He said, \n          'No, it is from Allah.' Whenever Allah's Apostle became happy, his \n          face would shine as if it were a piece of moon, and we all knew that \n          characteristic of him. When I sat before him, I said, 'O Allah's \n          Apostle! Because of the acceptance of my repentance I will give up all\n          my wealth as alms for the Sake of Allah and His Apostle. Allah's \n          Apostle said, 'Keep some of your wealth, as it will be better for \n          you.' I said, 'So I will keep my share from Khaibar with me,' and \n          added, 'O Allah's Apostle! Allah has saved me for telling the truth; \n          so it is a part of my repentance not to tell but the truth as long as \n          I am alive. By Allah, I do not know anyone of the Muslims whom Allah \n          has helped fortelling the truth more than me. Since I have mentioned \n          that truth to Allah's Apostle till today, I have never intended to \n          tell a lie. I hope that Allah will also save me (from telling lies) \n          the rest of my life. So Allah revealed to His Apostle the Verse:--\n         \"Verily, Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin (i.e. Emigrants\n          (up to His Saying) And be with those who are true (in word and deed).\"\n          (9.117-119) \n         By Allah, Allah has never bestowed upon me, apart from His guiding me \n          to Islam, a Greater blessing than the fact that I did not tell a lie \n          to Allah's Apostle which would have caused me to perish as those who \n          have told a lie perished, for Allah described those who told lies with\n          the worst description He ever attributed to anybody else. Allah \n          said:-- \"They (i.e. the hypocrites) will swear by Allah to you when \n          you return to them (up to His Saying) Certainly Allah is not pleased \n          with the rebellious people--\" (9.95-96) Kab added, \"We, the three \n          persons, differed altogether from those whose excuses Allah's Apostle \n          accepted when they swore to him. He took their pledge of allegiance \n          and asked Allah to forgive them, but Allah's Apostle left our case \n          pending till Allah gave His Judgment about it.

Who were the two ladies\n          from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Allah said: 'If you\n          two (wives of the Prophet) turn in repentance to Allah your hearts are\n          indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet likes)?\" (66.4) He \n          said, \"I am astonished at your question, O Ibn Abbas. They were 'Aisha\n          and Hafsa.\" Then 'Umar went on narrating the Hadith and said, \"I and \n          an Ansari neighbor of mine from Bani Umaiyya bin Zaid who used to live\n          in Awali-al-Medina, used to visit the Prophet in turn. He used to go \n          one day and I another day. When I went, I would bring him the news of \n          what had happened that day regarding the Divine Inspiration and other \n          things, and when he went, he used to do the same for me. We, the \n          people of Quraish used to have the upper hand over our wives, but when\n          we came to the Ansar, we found that their women had the upper hand \n          over their men, so our women also started learning the ways of the \n          Ansari women. I shouted at my wife and she retorted against me and I \n          disliked that she should answer me back. She said to me, 'Why are you \n          so surprised at my answering you back? By Allah, the wives of the \n          Prophet answer him back and some of them may leave (does not speak to)\n          him throughout the day till the night.' The (talk) scared me and I \n          said to her, 'Whoever has done so will be ruined!' Then I proceeded \n          after dressing myself, and entered upon Hafsa and said to her, 'Does \n          anyone of you keep the Prophet angry till night?' She said, 'Yes.' I \n          said, 'You are a ruined losing person! Don't you fear that Allah may \n          get angry for the anger of Allah's Apostle and thus you will be \n          ruined? So do not ask more from the Prophet and do not answer him back\n          and do not give up talking to him. Ask me whatever you need and do not\n          be tempted to imitate your neighbor (i.e., 'Aisha) in her manners for \n          she is more charming than you and more beloved to the Prophet .\" Umar \n          added,\"At that time a talk was circulating among us that (the tribe \n          of) Ghassan were preparing their horses to invade us. My Ansari \n          companion, on the day of his turn, went (to the town) and returned to \n          us at night and knocked at my door violently and asked if I was there.\n          I became horrified and came out to him. He said, 'Today a great thing \n          has happened.' I asked, 'What is it? Have (the people of) Ghassan \n          come?' He said, 'No, but (What has happened) is greater and more \n          horrifying than that: Allah's Apostle; has divorced his wives. 'Umar \n          added, \"The Prophet kept away from his wives and I said \"Hafsa is a \n          ruined loser.' I had already thought that most probably this (divorce)\n          would happen in the near future. So I dressed myself and offered the \n          morning prayer with the Prophet and then the Prophet; entered an upper\n          room and stayed there in seclusion. I entered upon Hafsa and saw her \n          weeping. I asked, 'What makes you weep? Did I not warn you about that?\n          Did the Prophet divorce you all?' She said, 'I do not know. There he \n          is retired alone in the upper room.' I came out and sat near the \n          pulpit and saw a group of people sitting around it and some of them \n          were weeping. I sat with them for a while but could not endure the \n          situation, so I went to the upper room where the Prophet; was and said\n          to a black slave of his, 'Will you get the permission (of the Prophet \n          ) for 'Umar (to enter)?' The slave went in, talked to the Prophet \n          about it and then returned saying, 'I have spoken to the Prophet and \n          mentioned you but he kept quiet.' Then I returned and sat with the \n          group of people sitting near the pulpit. but I could not bear the \n          situation and once again I said to the slave, 'Will you get the \n          permission for 'Umar?' He went in and returned saying, 'I mentioned \n          you to him but he kept quiet.' So I returned again and sat with the \n          group of people sitting near the pulpit, but I could not bear the \n          situation, and so I went to the slave and said, 'Will you get the \n          permission for 'Umar?' He went in and returned to me saying, 'I \n          mentioned you to him but he kept quiet.' When I was leaving, behold! \n          The slave called me, saying, 'The Prophet has given you permission.' \n          Then I entered upon Allah's Apostle and saw him Lying on a bed made of\n          stalks of date palm leaves and there was no bedding between it and \n          him. The stalks left marks on his side and he was leaning on a leather\n          pillow stuffed with date-palm fires. I greeted him and while still \n          standing I said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Have you divorced your wives?' He\n          looked at me and said, 'No.' I said, 'Allah Akbar!' And then, while \n          still standing, I said chatting, 'Will you heed what I say, O Allah's \n          Apostle? We, the people of Quraish used to have power over our women, \n          but when we arrived at Medina we found that the men (here) were \n          overpowered by their women.' The Prophet smiled and then I said to \n          him, 'Will you heed what I say, O Allah's Apostle? I entered upon \n          Hafsa and said to her, \"Do not be tempted to imitate your companion \n          ('Aisha), for she is more charming than you and more beloved to the \n          Prophet.' \" The Prophet smiled for a second time. When I saw him \n          smiling, I sat down. Then I looked around his house, and by Allah, I \n          could not see anything of importance in his house except three hides, \n          so I said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Invoke Allah to make your followers \n          rich, for the Persians and the Romans have been made prosperous and \n          they have been given (the pleasures of the world), although they do \n          not worship Allah.' Thereupon the Prophet sat up as he was reclining. \n          and said, 'Are you of such an opinion, O the son of Al-Khattab? These \n          are the people who have received the rewards for their good deeds in \n          this world.' I said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Ask Allah to forgive me.' \n          Then the Prophet kept away from his wives for twenty-nine days because\n          of the story which Hafsa had disclosed to 'Aisha. The Prophet had \n          said, 'I will not enter upon them (my wives) for one month,' because \n          of his anger towards them, when Allah had admonished him.  So, when \n          twenty nine days had passed, the Prophet first entered upon 'Aisha. \n          'Aisha said to him, 'O Allah's Apostle! You had sworn that you would \n          not enter upon us for one month, but now only twenty-nine days have \n          passed, for I have been counting them one by one.' The Prophet said, \n          'The (present) month is of twenty nine days.' 'Aisha added, 'Then \n          Allah revealed the Verses of the option. (2) And out of all his-wives \n          he asked me first, and I chose him.' Then he gave option to his other \n          wives and they said what 'Aisha had said . \" (1) The Prophet, ' had \n          decided to abstain from eating a certain kind of food because of a \n          certain event, so Allah blamed him for doing so. Some of his wives \n          were the cause of him taking that decision, therefore he deserted them\n          for one month.

Allah sent Muhammad with \n          the Truth and revealed the Holy Book to him, and among what Allah \n          revealed, was the Verse of the Rajam (the stoning of married person \n          (male &amp; female) who commits illegal sexual intercourse, and we did \n          recite this Verse and understood and memorized it. Allah's Apostle did\n          carry out the punishment of stoning and so did we after him. \n         I am afraid that after a long time has passed, somebody will say, 'By \n          Allah, we do not find the Verse of the Rajam in Allah's Book,' and \n          thus they will go astray by leaving an obligation which Allah has \n          revealed.

Do not claim to be the offspring of other \n          than your fathers, as it is disbelief (unthankfulness) on your part \n          that you claim to be the offspring of other than your real father.' \n          Then Allah's Apostle said, 'Do not praise me excessively as Jesus, son\n          of Marry was praised, but call me Allah's Slave and His Apostles.' (O \n          people!) I have been informed that a speaker amongst you says, 'By \n          Allah, if 'Umar should die, I will give the pledge of allegiance to \n          such-and-such person.' One should not deceive oneself by saying that \n          the pledge of allegiance given to Abu Bakr was given suddenly and it \n          was successful. No doubt, it was like that, but Allah saved (the \n          people) from its evil, and there is none among you who has the \n          qualities of Abu Bakr. Remember that whoever gives the pledge of \n          allegiance to anybody among you without consulting the other Muslims, \n          neither that person, nor the person to whom the pledge of allegiance \n          was given, are to be supported, lest they both should be killed.  \n         And no doubt after the death of the Prophet we were informed that the \n          Ansar disagreed with us and gathered in the shed of Bani Sa'da. 'Ali \n          and Zubair and whoever was with them, opposed us, while the emigrants \n          gathered with Abu Bakr. I said to Abu Bakr, 'Let's go to these Ansari \n          brothers of ours.' So we set out seeking them, and when we approached \n          them, two pious men of theirs met us and informed us of the final \n          decision of the Ansar, and said, 'O group of Muhajirin (emigrants) ! \n          Where are you going?' We replied, 'We are going to these Ansari \n          brothers of ours.' They said to us, 'You shouldn't go near them. Carry\n          out whatever we have already decided.' I said, 'By Allah, we will go \n          to them.' And so we proceeded until we reached them at the shed of \n          Bani Sa'da. Behold! There was a man sitting amongst them and wrapped \n          in something. I asked, 'Who is that man?' They said, 'He is Sa'd bin \n          'Ubada.' I asked, 'What is wrong with him?' They said, 'He is sick.' \n          After we sat for a while, the Ansar's speaker said, 'None has the \n          right to be worshipped but Allah,' and praising Allah as He deserved, \n          he added, 'To proceed, we are Allah's Ansar (helpers) and the majority\n          of the Muslim army, while you, the emigrants, are a small group and \n          some people among you came with the intention of preventing us from \n          practicing this matter (of caliphate) and depriving us of it.' \n         When the speaker had finished, I intended to speak as I had prepared a\n          speech which I liked and which I wanted to deliver in the presence of \n          Abu Bakr, and I used to avoid provoking him. So, when I wanted to \n          speak, Abu Bakr said, 'Wait a while.' I disliked to make him angry. So\n          Abu Bakr himself gave a speech, and he was wiser and more patient than\n          I. By Allah, he never missed a sentence that I liked in my own \n          prepared speech, but he said the like of it or better than it \n          spontaneously. After a pause he said, 'O Ansar! You deserve all (the \n          qualities that you have attributed to yourselves, but this question \n          (of Caliphate) is only for the Quraish as they are the best of the \n          Arabs as regards descent and home, and I am pleased to suggest that \n          you choose either of these two men, so take the oath of allegiance to \n          either of them as you wish. And then Abu Bakr held my hand and Abu \n          Ubada bin Abdullah's hand who was sitting amongst us. I hated nothing \n          of what he had said except that proposal, for by Allah, I would rather\n          have my neck chopped off as expiator for a sin than become the ruler \n          of a nation, one of whose members is Abu Bakr, unless at the time of \n          my death my own-self suggests something I don't feel at present.'\n         And then one of the Ansar said, 'I am the pillar on which the camel \n          with a skin disease (eczema) rubs itself to satisfy the itching (i.e.,\n          I am a noble), and I am as a high class palm tree! O Quraish. There \n          should be one ruler from us and one from you.' \n         Then there was a hue and cry among the gathering and their voices rose\n          so that I was afraid there might be great disagreement, so I said, 'O \n          Abu Bakr! Hold your hand out.' He held his hand out and I pledged \n          allegiance to him, and then all the emigrants gave the Pledge of \n          allegiance and so did the Ansar afterwards.  And so we became \n          victorious over Sa'd bin Ubada (whom Al-Ansar wanted to make a ruler).\n          One of the Ansar said, 'You have killed Sa'd bin Ubada.' I replied, \n          'Allah has killed Sa'd bin Ubada.' Umar added, \"By Allah, apart from \n          the great tragedy that had  happened to us (i.e. the death of the \n          Prophet), there was no greater problem than the allegiance pledged to \n          Abu Bakr because we were afraid that if we left the people, they might\n          give the Pledge of allegiance after us to one of their men, in which \n          case we would have given them our consent for something against our \n          real wish, or would have opposed them and caused great trouble. So if \n          any person gives the Pledge of allegiance to somebody (to become a \n          Caliph)  without consulting the other Muslims, then the one he has \n          selected should not be granted allegiance, lest both of them should be\n          killed.\"\n                \n      "},{"id":5682,"hadith":" Narrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Jihani:\n         I heard the Prophet ordering that an unmarried person guilty of \n          illegal sexual intercourse be flogged one-hundred stripes and be \n          exiled for one year.
